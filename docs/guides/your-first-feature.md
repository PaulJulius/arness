# Your First Feature

This guide walks through building a feature from scratch using Arness Code. You'll go from a one-sentence idea to a shipped PR.

Examples show host-neutral skill names. In Claude Code, invoke them with a slash prefix; in Codex, prompt with the same skill name.

## Prerequisites

- Arness Code installed in Claude Code: `/plugin install arn-code@arn-marketplace`
- Arness Code installed in Codex: `codex plugin add arn-code@arn-marketplace`

## Step 1: Start Planning

```
arn-planning
```

In Codex, use the same skill name in your prompt:

```
codex "arn-planning add email notifications when a subscription is about to expire"
```

Arness asks what you want to build. Describe your feature in plain language:

> "I need to add email notifications when a user's subscription is about to expire."

Arness assesses the scope and routes you to the appropriate ceremony tier — swift for small changes, standard for medium, thorough for complex features.

## Step 2: Develop the Specification

For a medium-to-complex feature, Arness invokes the architect agent to refine your idea into a structured specification. It asks clarifying questions:

- What triggers the notification?
- How far in advance should it fire?
- What channels (email, in-app, both)?
- What existing code handles subscriptions?

The spec is saved as a Markdown file in `.arness/specs/`. You can review and edit it before proceeding.

## Step 3: Generate the Plan

Arness generates an implementation plan — phased, with task dependencies and acceptance criteria. For complex features, the plan is broken into phases:

- Phase 1: Data layer (expiration query, notification preferences)
- Phase 2: Notification service (email templates, delivery)
- Phase 3: Scheduling (cron job, retry logic)

You review the plan and approve, adjust, or request changes.

## Step 4: Execute

```
arn-implementing
```

In Codex:

```
codex "arn-implementing"
```

Arness converts the plan into a task list with dependencies, then dispatches task-executor agents. Independent tasks run in parallel; dependent tasks wait for their blockers to complete. Each task is reviewed by a task-reviewer agent before moving on.

After execution, a simplification pass looks for optimization opportunities, and a review checks the implementation against your plan and codebase patterns.

## Step 5: Ship

```
arn-shipping
```

In Codex:

```
codex "arn-shipping"
```

Arness commits, pushes, and creates a PR with a structured description that references the spec and plan. The PR description includes what changed, why, and how to test it.

## Step 6: Handle PR Feedback

If reviewers leave comments:

```
arn-reviewing-pr
```

In Codex:

```
codex "arn-reviewing-pr"
```

Arness fetches the PR comments, validates each finding against the codebase, and categorizes them as fix, defer, or reject. Approved fixes are applied and the PR is updated.

## What You Produced

At the end of this workflow, your `.arness/` directory contains:

- A **specification** documenting what you decided to build and why
- A **plan** with phased implementation strategy
- **Execution reports** showing what each agent did
- A **review report** with quality findings
- A **PR** with structured description

A new team member reading these artifacts can understand the entire feature — no context needed beyond what's in the files.

## Tips

- **Skip any step** — every stage has a skip option. If you already have a plan, jump to `arn-implementing`.
- **Change ceremony mid-stream** — if a feature turns out more complex than expected, you can escalate from swift to standard or thorough.
- **Use `arn-code-help`** — if you lose track of where you are in the pipeline, this skill detects your state and suggests the next step.
