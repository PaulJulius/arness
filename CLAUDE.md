# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code and Codex when working with code in this repository.

## Project Purpose

Arness is a plugin marketplace for Claude Code and Codex containing three independently installable plugins for development, greenfield exploration, and infrastructure. The repository is itself a valid local plugin marketplace, so plugins can be tested from the checkout.

## Architecture

```

└── assets/                             # Shared assets (banner, etc.)
```

**Key rule:** All plugin component directories (skills/, agents/) must be at the plugin root, NOT inside `.claude-plugin/`.

## Template Management

When updating default report templates in `plugins/arn-code/skills/arn-code-save-plan/report-templates/default/`:

1. Make changes to the template JSON files
2. Bump `version` in the relevant plugin's `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`, the matching legacy `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` when it carries a version, and the root `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` entry
3. Test by running `arn-code-init` in a test project -- templates will be copied and fresh checksums generated
4. Projects using the previous version will be prompted to update on next Arness skill invocation (behavior depends on their `Template updates` preference)

Checksums are generated at init-time by Claude (via `sha256sum` or `shasum -a 256`), not pre-computed in the repository.

Agent model profile files (`.arness/agent-models/<plugin>.md`) follow the same versioning and update policy as report templates: each preset carries a `# Version:` header, ensure-config detects version drift on each invocation, and the project's `Template updates: ask | auto | manual` setting controls update behavior. User edits to the file (detected via checksum mismatch) auto-flip the corresponding `## Arness` profile field to `custom` so future preset updates do not overwrite user customizations. See "Agent Model Profiles" below for the field-level behavior.

## Plugin Component Conventions

### Skills (preferred for new functionality)
- Each skill lives in `plugins/<plugin>/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`
- Frontmatter: `name`, `description` (trigger conditions — use "This skill should be used when..."), `version`
- Supporting files (references, scripts, examples) go in the same subdirectory

### Agents
- Files: `plugins/<plugin>/agents/<agent-name>.md`
- Frontmatter: `name`, `description` (with `<example>` blocks for triggers), `tools`, `model`, `color`

### When adding a new agent

Every new agent must be wired into both model profile presets so that users on either preset get a defined model assignment. Steps:

1. Create the agent file at `plugins/<plugin>/agents/<agent-name>.md` with frontmatter (`model: opus`).
2. Add the agent to BOTH `all-opus.md` and `balanced.md` presets in `plugins/<plugin>/skills/<plugin>-init/references/agent-models-presets/`. Decide the tier in `balanced` per the existing tiering principles (heavy reasoning → `opus`, operational/structured work → `sonnet`).
3. Bump each preset's `# Version:` header (e.g., `1.0.0` → `1.1.0`).
4. Bump the plugin version in the marketplace entry per the existing semver rules in the "Versioning" section below.
5. If the new agent is invoked from any skill, that dispatch site must include the model lookup per the "Dispatch convention" in `plugins/<plugin>/skills/<plugin>-ensure-config/references/ensure-config.md`.

### User Interaction Convention
- In Codex-facing instructions, use normal user prompt language for discrete choices. In Claude Code-only instructions, use `Ask (using \`AskUserQuestion\`):` followed by the bold question text and numbered options
- Conversational exploration loops (open-ended back-and-forth) remain as plain text
- Free-form text input prompts ("describe what you want") remain as plain text
- Informational "next steps" lists (sequential workflow guidance) remain as plain text
- Multi-select choices use `multiSelect: true` with clear multi-select instruction text
- Menus with more than 4 options MUST be restructured into layered questions (2-4 options per layer)
- AskUserQuestion is only available in Claude Code's main conversation — agents/subagents and Codex fallback flows cannot use it

### Path References
**No user-specific paths in committed files.** Never embed usernames, home directories, or machine-specific absolute paths (e.g., `/home/username/...`) in any file that gets committed — including skills, agents, specs, plans, and documentation. Use host-neutral placeholders such as `<arn-code-plugin-root>`, `<arn-spark-plugin-root>`, `<arn-infra-plugin-root>`, relative paths, or generic placeholders like `/path/to/arness` instead.

When running from this repository, resolve `<arn-code-plugin-root>` to `plugins/arn-code`, `<arn-spark-plugin-root>` to `plugins/arn-spark`, and `<arn-infra-plugin-root>` to `plugins/arn-infra`. When installed, resolve each placeholder to that plugin's installed root. Existing `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` references are legacy Claude Code placeholders; new or edited cross-host instructions should prefer the explicit Arness placeholders above.

## Versioning

When creating a PR, always suggest bumping the `version` in the affected plugin's `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` and keeping the legacy `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` version for that plugin in sync. If a per-plugin `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` carries a version, keep that in sync too. Follow semver:

- **Patch** (0.1.0 → 0.1.1): Bug fixes, typo corrections, minor wording changes
- **Minor** (0.1.0 → 0.2.0): New features, new skills/commands/agents, significant behavior changes to existing components
- **Major** (0.2.0 → 1.0.0): Breaking changes that require users to re-run `arn-code-init` or manually update their `## Arness` config

Include the version bump in the PR commit, not as a separate commit. Validate metadata with `jq . .agents/plugins/marketplace.json .claude-plugin/marketplace.json plugins/*/.codex-plugin/plugin.json`.

## Linting Configuration

Each project's `## Arness` block carries a `Linting:` field with one of three values:

- **`enabled`** — run lint and format checks as a hard gate. The codebase analyzer detects per-service linters and formatters and writes them to `<code-patterns-dir>/linting.md`. The `arn-code-task-executor` runs check-mode invocations on touched files at task completion (silent — findings flow into the implementation report). The `arn-code-ship` skill runs the same checks against the staged diff before commit and surfaces a 3-option menu (Fix now / File a backlog issue / Proceed with documented reason) when issues are found, with the suggested default adapting to issue count.
- **`none`** — project has no linters or formatters configured. Gates are skipped silently in both executor and ship.
- **`skip`** — user explicitly disabled the gate. Same behavior as `none`; provided so the user can opt back in later.

When the field is missing, `arn-code-ensure-config` (Layer 2c) prompts the user with the same 3-option menu and, if `enabled` is chosen, invokes the codebase analyzer to generate `linting.md`.

The analyzer is technology-agnostic: it does not pattern-match against a fixed list of tool names. Instead it scans evidence categories (dependency manifests, tool config files, script entry points, pre-commit-style runners) and recognizes whatever tooling the project actually uses. Linters and formatters are listed separately in `linting.md` because they have different semantics — formatters typically have both a check mode and a write mode, and the gate must invoke the check mode (`Discovered check command`) so files are never silently rewritten.

## Agent Model Profiles

Each plugin's subagents can run under a user-selectable model profile, letting cost-sensitive users opt out of all-Opus invocation without forking the plugin. The choice is per-plugin and editable.

Each project's `## Arness` block carries one field per installed plugin:

- **Code agent model profile:** `all-opus | balanced | custom`
- **Spark agent model profile:** `all-opus | balanced | custom`
- **Infra agent model profile:** `all-opus | balanced | custom`

Semantics:

- **`all-opus`** — every subagent runs on Opus. Default for new projects; preserves current behavior.
- **`balanced`** — Opus for heavy reasoning agents (planners, architects, reviewers); Sonnet for operational/structured agents (executors, scaffolders, dispatch helpers). Per-agent assignments live in `.arness/agent-models/<plugin>.md`.
- **`custom`** — the project's `.arness/agent-models/<plugin>.md` has been hand-edited. Set automatically when ensure-config detects a checksum mismatch against the named preset; future preset updates skip the file so customizations are preserved.

The three fields are independent — only the plugins a user has installed need a corresponding field. Default is `all-opus`. The active per-agent model assignments live in `.arness/agent-models/<plugin>.md`, copied at init-time from `plugins/<plugin>/skills/<plugin>-init/references/agent-models-presets/<choice>.md`. Each dispatch site reads this file and passes the resolved model as the Task tool's `model:` parameter, overriding the agent's frontmatter.

Updates flow through the same checksum + version + `Template updates: ask | auto | manual` policy as report templates (see "Template Management" above). When a plugin ships a new preset version, ensure-config compares the project's stored version against the plugin version and either auto-updates, prompts, or skips per the user's policy. Hand-editing `.arness/agent-models/<plugin>.md` flips the corresponding profile field to `custom` so subsequent preset bumps do not clobber the edits.

## Testing Locally as a Plugin

```bash
# Test a single plugin (from the repo root)
claude --plugin-dir plugins/arn-code

claude --plugin-dir plugins/arn-infra

# Or install from the local marketplace:
# /plugin marketplace add /absolute/path/to/arness
# /plugin install arn-code@arn-marketplace
```
