# Arness Infra Knowledge Base

Reference documentation for the `arn-infra-doctor` agent. Describes the Arness Infra plugin's pipeline modes, configuration requirements, expected file structures, common failure modes, and inter-skill data flow.

## Pipeline Maps

Arness Infra operates in two distinct modes depending on the complexity and governance requirements of the infrastructure change.

### Quick Mode (Interactive)

For ad-hoc infrastructure tasks — containerization, IaC generation, deployment, and monitoring. Each skill can be invoked independently.

```
arn-infra-discover → arn-infra-containerize → arn-infra-define → arn-infra-env → arn-infra-secrets → arn-infra-pipeline → arn-infra-deploy → arn-infra-verify → arn-infra-monitor
```

### Full Pipeline Mode (Structured Change Management)

For tracked infrastructure changes with phases, rollback checkpoints, and review gates.

```
arn-infra-change-spec → arn-infra-change-plan → arn-infra-save-plan → arn-infra-execute-change → arn-infra-review-change → arn-infra-document-change
```

### Standalone Skills

These skills operate outside both pipeline modes:
- `arn-infra-wizard` — guided pipeline orchestrator (sequences either Quick or Full Pipeline mode)
- `arn-infra-assess` — comprehensive infrastructure assessment, un-deferral, backlog generation
- `arn-infra-cleanup` — TTL-based resource expiry and destruction
- `arn-infra-migrate` — provider migration, PaaS graduation, consolidation
- `arn-infra-refresh` — update evolving reference files via online research
- `arn-infra-triage` — process incoming infrastructure request issues from Arness Code
- `arn-infra-help` — pipeline position detection and next-step guidance
- `arn-infra-init` — optional provider/environment/IaC tool configuration
- `arn-infra-report` — diagnostic reporting (this skill)

## Config Requirements

## Common Failure Modes

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Diagnostic Check |
|---------|-------------|------------------|
| "Arness Infra not configured" | arn-infra-init/ensure-config not run, or CLAUDE.md overwritten | Check CLAUDE.md for `## Arness` with infra fields |
| Provider not configured | No `Providers` field or empty providers list | Check `Providers` in `## Arness` |
| IaC tool not installed | terraform/tofu/pulumi/cdk/bicep not on PATH | Run `tofu version`, `terraform version`, `pulumi version` |
| Docker not available | Docker daemon not running or not installed | Run `docker --version`, `docker compose version` |
| Cloud CLI auth failure | aws/gcloud/az not authenticated or token expired | Run `aws sts get-caller-identity`, `gcloud auth list`, `az account show` |
| Deployment to wrong environment | Environments config incorrect or promotion order violated | Check `Environments` field and `environments.md` |
| Cost threshold exceeded during deploy | Estimated cost exceeds `Cost threshold` | Check `Cost threshold` in config and cost-analyst output |
| Security audit blocks deployment | Checkov/Trivy findings at blocking severity | Check validation-ladder.md and `Validation ceiling` field |
| Verification fails | Health check, DNS, or SSL validation failure post-deploy | Check `environments.md` for verification state |
| Change plan execution phase fails mid-way | Phase dependency failure, IaC apply error, or rollback triggered | Check PROGRESS_TRACKER.json for phase status |
| Rollback checkpoint not created | execute-change skipped checkpoint step or disk write failed | Check `<project>/reports/` for rollback artifacts |
| Reference files stale | Reference version mismatch after plugin update | Compare `Reference version` with plugin version |
| Resource manifest out of sync | Manual changes outside Arness or failed deploy left stale state | Check `active-resources.json` vs actual cloud state |
| CI/CD pipeline generation fails | CI/CD platform not configured or unsupported | Check `CI/CD platform` field in config |
| Secrets scan finds exposed credentials | Hardcoded secrets in IaC or config files | Check secrets-audit output, not source code |
| Cleanup skill finds no TTL resources | Resource manifest empty or no TTL tags configured | Check `active-resources.json` for TTL fields |
| Migration fails at cutover step | Target provider not reachable or DNS propagation incomplete | Check migrate skill output for cutover errors |
| Tooling manifest empty after discover | Discover skill completed but no tools detected | Check `tooling-manifest.json` for entries |
| Save-plan can't find PLAN_PREVIEW_INFRA_*.md | change-plan was not run, or plan was not approved | Check `<infra-plans-dir>/` for PLAN_PREVIEW_INFRA_*.md files |
| Environment promotion blocked | Staging not verified or verification failed | Check `environments.md` for staging verification state |
| Labels not created on GitHub | gh auth lacks permission or Platform not github | Check `Platform` field, run `gh auth status` |
