# Arness Infra Execute Change

Orchestrate the phased execution of a structured infrastructure change plan. For each phase, this skill runs a 7-step dispatch loop: rollback checkpoint, IaC generation, security gate, cost gate, deployment, verification, and review gate. It tracks progress in PROGRESS_TRACKER.json and produces per-phase INFRA_CHANGE_REPORT_PHASE_N.json reports.

This skill consumes the structured project created by `arn-infra-save-plan` and coordinates all existing infrastructure agents (specialist, security-auditor, cost-analyst, verifier) plus the new change-reviewer agent.

Pipeline position:
```
arn-infra-init -> arn-infra-change-spec -> arn-infra-change-plan -> arn-infra-save-plan -> **arn-infra-execute-change** -> arn-infra-review-change -> arn-infra-document-change
```

## Prerequisites

Read `## Arness` from the project's CLAUDE.md. If no `## Arness` section exists or Arness Infra fields are missing, inform the user: "Arness Infra is not configured for this project yet. Run `arn-infra-wizard` to get started — it will set everything up automatically." Do not proceed without it.

Check the **Deferred** field. If `Deferred: yes`, inform the user: "Infrastructure is in deferred mode. Change execution is not available until infrastructure is fully configured. Run `arn-infra-assess` to un-defer." Stop.

Extract:
- **Infra plans directory** -- where structured plan projects live (default: `.arness/infra-plans`)
- **Providers** -- cloud providers configured
- **Providers config** -- path to `providers.md`
- **Environments** -- environment names in promotion order
- **Environments config** -- path to `environments.md`
- **Experience level** -- derived from user profile. Read `~/.arness/user-profile.yaml` (or `.claude/arness-profile.local.md` if it exists — project override takes precedence). Apply the experience derivation mapping from `<arn-infra-plugin-root>/skills/arn-infra-ensure-config/references/experience-derivation.md`. If no profile exists, check for legacy `Experience level` in `## Arness` as fallback.
- **Cost threshold** -- monthly budget limit for cost gate warnings (default: `100`)
- **Default IaC tool** -- default IaC tool
- **Tooling manifest** -- path to `tooling-manifest.json`
- **Resource manifest** -- path to `active-resources.json`

### Locate the Structured Plan Project

Search for structured plan projects in the **Infra plans directory**:

```
Glob <infra-plans-dir>/*/PROGRESS_TRACKER.json
```

**If one project found:** Auto-select it.
**If multiple projects found:** Present the list with project names and overall status from each PROGRESS_TRACKER.json. Ask the user to select.
**If no project found:** Inform the user: "No structured plan project found. Run `arn-infra-save-plan` to create one from a plan preview."

Read `PROGRESS_TRACKER.json` to determine current phase and execution state. If a phase is `in_progress`, offer to resume from the last completed step.

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Present Execution Plan

Read the project's INTRODUCTION.md and present an execution summary:

"**Infrastructure Change Execution:**
- **Project:** [project name]
- **Phases:** [total] ([completed] completed, [remaining] remaining)
- **Current phase:** [N] -- [title] (targeting [environment])
- **Blast radius:** [classification for current phase]
- **Cost budget remaining:** $[amount]

Proceed with Phase [N]?"

**Token consumption warning:** If the project has 5+ phases or 20+ resources, warn: "This is a large change with [N] phases and [M] resources. Execution will consume significant context. Consider executing one phase at a time."

---

### Step 2: Per-Phase Dispatch Loop

> Read `<arn-infra-plugin-root>/skills/arn-infra-execute-change/references/dispatch-loop.md` for the detailed dispatch loop logic.

For the current phase, execute the 7-step dispatch loop:

#### Step 2.1: Create Rollback Checkpoint

Before making any changes, create a rollback checkpoint:
- Backup IaC state files (state pull/export)
- Record the current resource manifest state
- Note the checkpoint path in the phase report

Update PROGRESS_TRACKER.json: set phase execution status to `in_progress`.

#### Step 2.2: Invoke IaC Generation (arn-infra-specialist)

Read the phase plan (`PHASE_N_PLAN.md`) and invoke the `arn-infra-specialist` agent with structured context:

```text
--- PHASE PLAN ---
[full content of PHASE_N_PLAN.md]
--- END PHASE PLAN ---

--- PROVIDER CONFIG ---
[provider configuration from providers.md]
--- END PROVIDER CONFIG ---

--- INFRASTRUCTURE CONTEXT ---
Project: [project name]
Phase: [N] of [total]
Environment: [target environment]
IaC Tool: [tool]
Blast Radius: [classification]
--- END INFRASTRUCTURE CONTEXT ---

--- GENERATION INSTRUCTIONS ---
Generate the IaC configurations for all resources listed in the phase plan.
Follow the resource specifications exactly. Use the configured IaC tool.
Generate environment-specific variable files. Include resource tagging.
--- END GENERATION INSTRUCTIONS ---
```

#### Step 2.3: Security Gate (arn-infra-security-auditor)

> Read `<arn-infra-plugin-root>/skills/arn-infra-execute-change/references/gate-policies.md` for security gate enforcement rules.

Invoke the `arn-infra-security-auditor` agent via the Task tool to scan the generated IaC, passing the model from `.arness/agent-models/infra.md` as the `model` parameter (see `plugins/arn-infra/skills/arn-infra-ensure-config/references/ensure-config.md` "Dispatch convention" for fallback). Context:

```text
--- IaC ARTIFACTS ---
[list of generated files with content]
--- END IaC ARTIFACTS ---

--- SECURITY CONTEXT ---
Environment: [target environment]
Blast radius: [classification]
Security requirements: [from phase plan]
--- END SECURITY CONTEXT ---

--- SCAN INSTRUCTIONS ---
Scan the generated IaC for security issues. Report findings by severity
(CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW). Check for: exposed ports, public access,
missing encryption, overly permissive IAM, hardcoded secrets.
--- END SCAN INSTRUCTIONS ---
```

**Gate evaluation (per gate-policies.md):**
- CRITICAL findings: block execution, present findings, require fix-and-retry or abort
- HIGH findings: present findings with risk assessment, require explicit acknowledgment
- MEDIUM/LOW findings: log in phase report, proceed

Update PROGRESS_TRACKER.json: set `securityGate.status`.

#### Step 2.4: Cost Gate (arn-infra-cost-analyst)

Invoke the `arn-infra-cost-analyst` agent via the Task tool to estimate costs, passing the model from `.arness/agent-models/infra.md` as the `model` parameter (see `plugins/arn-infra/skills/arn-infra-ensure-config/references/ensure-config.md` "Dispatch convention" for fallback). Context:

```text
--- IaC ARTIFACTS ---
[generated IaC content]
--- END IaC ARTIFACTS ---

--- COST CONTEXT ---
Cost threshold: [from config]
Cumulative cost so far: [from previous phases]
Budget remaining: [total budget - cumulative]
--- END COST CONTEXT ---

--- ESTIMATION INSTRUCTIONS ---
Estimate the monthly cost for all resources in this phase.
Break down costs per resource. Compare against the threshold.
Suggest cost optimizations if threshold is exceeded.
--- END ESTIMATION INSTRUCTIONS ---
```

**Gate evaluation (per gate-policies.md):**
- Exceeds threshold: present detailed breakdown, require acknowledgment, suggest alternatives
- Within threshold: log estimate, proceed

Update PROGRESS_TRACKER.json: set `costGate.status`.

#### Step 2.5: Execute Deployment

> Read `<arn-infra-plugin-root>/skills/arn-infra-execute-change/references/deploy-procedures.md` for per-tool deployment commands.

Execute the deployment using the procedures from `deploy-procedures.md`. Follow the same deployment flow as `arn-infra-deploy`:
- Run plan/preview command
- Present changes to user for confirmation
- Execute apply/deploy command
- Monitor deployment progress
- Update resource manifest on success

**User confirmation is required before every apply/deploy command.**

#### Step 2.6: Verification (arn-infra-verifier)

Invoke the `arn-infra-verifier` agent via the Task tool to validate the deployment, passing the model from `.arness/agent-models/infra.md` as the `model` parameter (see `plugins/arn-infra/skills/arn-infra-ensure-config/references/ensure-config.md` "Dispatch convention" for fallback). Context:

```text
--- DEPLOYED RESOURCES ---
[list of resources from this phase]
--- END DEPLOYED RESOURCES ---

--- VERIFICATION CONTEXT ---
Environment: [target environment]
Expected endpoints: [from phase plan]
Expected resource state: [from IaC output]
--- END VERIFICATION CONTEXT ---

--- VERIFICATION INSTRUCTIONS ---
Run health checks, DNS verification, SSL validation, and resource state
comparison for all deployed resources. Report PASS/WARN/FAIL verdict.
--- END VERIFICATION INSTRUCTIONS ---
```

Update PROGRESS_TRACKER.json: set `verification.status`.

#### Step 2.7: Review Gate (arn-infra-change-reviewer)

Invoke the `arn-infra-change-reviewer` agent via the Task tool for a phase-level review, passing the model from `.arness/agent-models/infra.md` as the `model` parameter (see `plugins/arn-infra/skills/arn-infra-ensure-config/references/ensure-config.md` "Dispatch convention" for fallback). Context:

```text
--- PHASE REPORT ---
[INFRA_CHANGE_REPORT content for this phase]
--- END PHASE REPORT ---

--- CHANGE SPEC ---
[original spec content]
--- END CHANGE SPEC ---

--- REVIEW INSTRUCTIONS ---
Review this single phase for security posture, cost compliance, blast radius
adherence, and rollback documentation. Provide a phase-level verdict.
--- END REVIEW INSTRUCTIONS ---
```

Update PROGRESS_TRACKER.json: set `review.verdict`.

---

### Step 3: Write Phase Report

After the dispatch loop completes:

> Read the report template: `Read <arn-infra-plugin-root>/skills/arn-infra-save-plan/report-templates/default/INFRA_CHANGE_REPORT_TEMPLATE.json`

Write `INFRA_CHANGE_REPORT_PHASE_N.json` to the project's `reports/` directory using the loaded template schema.

Update PROGRESS_TRACKER.json:
- Set phase execution status to `completed` (or `failed` / `rolled_back`)
- Update `lastUpdated` timestamp
- If all phases complete, set `overallStatus` to `completed`

---

### Step 4: Environment Promotion Gate

If the next phase targets a different environment:

"**Environment Promotion:**
Phase [N] ([current-env]) is complete. Phase [N+1] targets [next-env].

**Phase [N] Summary:**
- Resources: [N] created, [N] modified, [N] destroyed
- Security gate: [status]
- Cost gate: [status]
- Verification: [status]
- Review verdict: [verdict]

Ask the user:

**"Promote to [next-env]? This requires explicit approval."**

Options:
1. **Yes** -- Promote to [next-env] and continue execution
2. **No** -- Stop execution here

**User approval is required for every environment promotion.** Never auto-promote.

---

### Step 5: Continue or Complete

**If more phases remain:** Return to Step 2 for the next phase.

**If all phases complete:** Present the final summary:

"**Infrastructure Change Complete:**
- **Project:** [name]
- **Phases executed:** [N]
- **Resources provisioned:** [total]
- **Total estimated cost:** $[amount]/month
- **Overall review verdict:** [pass/warn/needs-fixes]

**Next steps:**
1. **Full review** -- Run `arn-infra-review-change` for a comprehensive cross-phase review
2. **Documentation** -- Run `arn-infra-document-change` to generate runbooks and changelog
3. **Monitor** -- Run `arn-infra-monitor` to set up observability"

---

### Parallel Batch Execution

For parallel execution of independent resources within the same environment, see the dispatch loop reference.

## Error Handling

- **`## Arness` config missing:** Suggest running `arn-infra-wizard` to get started. Stop.
- **Plan project not found:** Suggest running `arn-infra-save-plan` to create a structured project. Stop.
- **PROGRESS_TRACKER.json missing or corrupt:** Offer to regenerate from the phase plans. If the user agrees, scan the `plans/` directory and rebuild the tracker.
- **Agent invocation fails:** Report the error. Offer to retry the agent, skip the step (with warning), or abort execution. If aborting, trigger rollback for the current phase.
- **Security gate blocks:** Present the CRITICAL findings. Options: (1) Fix the IaC and retry, (2) Abort and rollback, (3) Do not offer "acknowledge and proceed" for CRITICAL findings.
- **Cost gate exceeds threshold:** Present the cost breakdown. Options: (1) Acknowledge and proceed, (2) Fix the configuration to reduce costs and retry, (3) Abort execution.
- **Deployment fails:** Capture error output. Offer: (1) Retry deployment, (2) Rollback using checkpoint, (3) Abort and leave current state. Update PROGRESS_TRACKER.json with failure status.
- **Verification fails:** Present the verification report. Offer: (1) Investigate and fix, (2) Rollback the phase, (3) Acknowledge and proceed (with warning logged).
- **Environment promotion denied:** Stop execution. The project remains in its current state. The user can resume later.
- **Resume from interruption:** Detect the last completed step from PROGRESS_TRACKER.json. Present: "Execution was interrupted at Phase [N], Step [step]. Resume from [next step]?" If yes, continue from the interrupted point. If no, offer to restart the phase.
- **Re-running is safe:** Re-running re-reads PROGRESS_TRACKER.json and resumes from the first incomplete phase. Completed phases are not re-executed unless the user explicitly requests it.
