# Arness Infra Cleanup

Check for expired ephemeral infrastructure resources across three TTL sources (issue tracker, TTL registry, resource manifest) and destroy them with user confirmation. Supports periodic monitoring via `/loop` for session-duration TTL enforcement.

This skill never auto-destroys resources. Every destruction requires explicit user confirmation with a summary of what will be destroyed and its associated cost.

## Prerequisites

Read `## Arness` from the project's CLAUDE.md. If no `## Arness` section exists or Arness Infra fields are missing, inform the user: "Arness Infra is not configured for this project yet. Run `arn-infra-wizard` to get started — it will set everything up automatically." Do not proceed without it.

Check the **Deferred** field. If `Deferred: yes`, inform the user: "Infrastructure is in deferred mode. Cleanup is not available until infrastructure is fully configured. Run `arn-infra-assess` to un-defer." Stop.

Extract:
- **Experience level** -- derived from user profile. Read `~/.arness/user-profile.yaml` (or `.claude/arness-profile.local.md` if it exists — project override takes precedence). Apply the experience derivation mapping from `<arn-infra-plugin-root>/skills/arn-infra-ensure-config/references/experience-derivation.md`. If no profile exists, check for legacy `Experience level` in `## Arness` as fallback.
- **Providers** -- which cloud providers are configured
- **Providers config** -- path to `providers.md`
- **Default IaC tool** -- for determining destroy commands
- **Environments** -- environment names in promotion order
- **Environments config** -- path to `environments.md` for per-environment deployment state
- **Resource manifest** -- path to `active-resources.json` for resource inventory
- **Reference overrides** -- path to local reference override directory (for evolving reference reads)
- **Platform** -- for issue tracker access
- **Issue tracker** -- for reading cleanup issues and updating labels
- **Tooling manifest** -- path to `tooling-manifest.json` for available CLIs

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Scan TTL Sources

Check all three TTL sources in priority order. Collect a unified list of resources with expired or near-expiry TTLs.

**Source 1: Issue Tracker (highest priority)**

If issue tracking is configured (Platform is github or Issue tracker is jira):

For GitHub:
```bash
gh issue list --label "arn-infra-cleanup" --state open --json number,title,body,createdAt
```

For Jira:
Query issues with label `arn-infra-cleanup` in the configured Jira project.

Parse each cleanup issue:
- Extract TTL expiry timestamp from the issue body (set by `arn-infra-deploy` during ephemeral deployments)
- Extract resource identifiers and destroy commands from the issue body
- Determine if the TTL has expired (expiry timestamp < current time)
- Determine if the TTL is approaching (within 1 hour of expiry) for early warning

**Source 2: TTL Registry (secondary)**

Check for the TTL registry file:

```
Read .arness/infra/ttl-registry.md
```

If the file exists, parse resource entries with their TTL timestamps. The TTL registry is a fallback for environments without issue tracking or for resources created outside the normal deployment flow.

Expected format:
```markdown
# TTL Registry

| Resource | Environment | Provider | Created | TTL Expiry | Destroy Command |
|----------|-------------|----------|---------|------------|-----------------|
| [name] | [env] | [provider] | [timestamp] | [expiry] | [command] |
```

**Source 3: Resource Manifest (tertiary)**

Read the resource manifest:

```
Read <resource-manifest-path>
```

Filter resources where:
- `ttl` is not null
- `ttl` timestamp is in the past (expired)
- `status` is `active` (not already destroyed)

---

### Step 2: Compile Expired Resource List

Merge results from all three sources, deduplicating by resource ID. For each expired resource, compile:

- Resource name and type
- Provider and region
- Environment
- Created timestamp
- TTL expiry timestamp (how long ago it expired)
- Estimated cost since creation (calculate: `monthly_cost × (hours_since_creation / 730)`)
- Destroy command (IaC-tool-appropriate)
- Source (which TTL source identified this resource)

**If no expired resources are found:**

Present: "No expired resources found. All TTLs are current."

If there are resources with TTLs approaching expiry (within 1 hour), list them as early warnings:
"The following resources will expire soon:
- [resource]: expires in [time remaining]"

Stop here (or if running via `/loop`, wait for the next interval).

**If expired resources are found:**

Continue to Step 3.

---

### Step 3: Present Expired Resources for Confirmation

Present each expired resource group (grouped by environment):

"The following resources have expired TTLs and are candidates for cleanup:

**Environment: [env]**

| Resource | Type | Provider | Expired | Cost Since Creation | Destroy Command |
|----------|------|----------|---------|--------------------| --------------- |
| [name] | [type] | [provider] | [time since expiry] | $[amount] | [command] |

**Total cost of expired resources:** $[total] (estimated charges since TTL expired)

Ask the user:

**"How would you like to handle the expired resources?"**

Options:
1. **Destroy all** -- Destroy all expired resources listed above
2. **Select** -- Choose which resources to destroy
3. **Extend TTL** -- Extend the TTL for some or all resources
4. **Skip** -- Do not destroy anything right now

**NEVER auto-destroy without confirmation.** Even when running via `/loop`, each cleanup cycle must ask for confirmation before destroying anything.

---

### Step 4: Execute Destruction

For each confirmed resource, execute the appropriate destroy command.

> Read the local override or plugin default for `rollback-patterns.md`.

**Destroy commands by IaC tool:**

| IaC Tool | Destroy Command |
|----------|----------------|
| OpenTofu | `tofu destroy -target=<resource> -var-file=environments/<env>.tfvars` |
| Terraform | `terraform destroy -target=<resource> -var-file=environments/<env>.tfvars` |
| Pulumi | `pulumi destroy --target <urn> --stack <env> --yes` |
| CDK | `cdk destroy --context env=<env>` |
| Bicep | `az resource delete --ids <resource-id>` |
| kubectl | `kubectl delete <resource-type> <name> -n <namespace>` |
| Helm | `helm uninstall <release> -n <namespace>` |
| Fly.io | `fly apps destroy <app-name> --yes` |
| Railway | `railway down` or delete via dashboard |
| Vercel | `vercel remove <project> --yes` |
| Netlify | `netlify sites:delete --id <site-id>` |
| Render | Delete via Render dashboard |

**For targeted IaC destruction (OpenTofu/Terraform):**

When destroying specific resources from a larger state file, use `-target` to avoid destroying the entire environment:
```bash
tofu destroy -target=module.<module>.<resource_type>.<name> -var-file=environments/<env>.tfvars
```

**For full environment teardown:**
If all resources in an environment are expired, offer full environment destruction:
```bash
tofu destroy -var-file=environments/<env>.tfvars
```

**Important:** Always ask for confirmation before executing destroy commands. Show the exact command that will be run.

---

### Step 5: Update Tracking

After successful destruction:

**5a. Update resource manifest:**
- Set `status` to `destroyed` for each destroyed resource
- Update `lastUpdated` timestamp
- Recalculate the summary section

**5b. Close/update cleanup issues:**
If the resource was tracked via an issue:
- For GitHub: close the issue with a comment "Resources destroyed by arn-infra-cleanup at [timestamp]"
  ```bash
  gh issue close <number> --comment "Resources destroyed by arn-infra-cleanup at [timestamp]."
  ```
- For Jira: transition the issue to Done/Closed

**5c. Update TTL registry:**
If the resource was tracked in `.arness/infra/ttl-registry.md`, remove the entry or mark it as destroyed.

**5d. Update Environments config:**
If all resources in an environment were destroyed (read from the Environments config path extracted in Prerequisites):
- Reset the environment entry: `Last deployed: --`, `Pending changes: none`

---

### Step 6: TTL Extension (if selected in Step 3)

If the user chose to extend TTL for some resources:

Ask: "How long would you like to extend the TTL? (e.g., 2h, 24h, 7d)"

For each selected resource:
1. Calculate new expiry timestamp (current time + extension duration)
2. Update `ttl` field in `active-resources.json`
3. Update the cleanup issue body with the new expiry (if issue-tracked)
4. Update TTL registry entry (if registry-tracked)

Present: "TTL extended for [N] resources. New expiry: [timestamp]. The next cleanup check will re-evaluate these resources."

---

### Step 7: Summarize

Present the cleanup summary:

"**Cleanup Summary:**
- **Resources destroyed:** [N]
- **Resources extended:** [N]
- **Resources skipped:** [N]
- **Estimated savings:** $[amount]/month (freed monthly cost)
- **Issues closed:** [N]

**Files updated:**
- [list all files modified]

**Remaining TTLs:**
- [resource]: expires [timestamp]
- [resource]: expires [timestamp]

**Periodic monitoring:**
To automatically check for expired resources, use:
`/loop 6h arn-infra-cleanup`

This will check TTLs every 6 hours during the current session and prompt for cleanup when resources expire."

---

## /loop Support

This skill supports periodic execution via the `/loop` command:

```
/loop 6h arn-infra-cleanup
```

When running in loop mode:
1. Each iteration runs Steps 1-2 (scan and compile)
2. If no expired resources: silently continues to the next interval (no output)
3. If expired resources found: presents the list and asks for confirmation (Step 3)
4. After confirmation (destroy/extend/skip): continues to the next interval
5. **NEVER auto-destroys.** Even in loop mode, destruction requires explicit confirmation.

Recommended loop intervals:
- **Development environments:** 1-2 hours (short-lived ephemeral deployments)
- **Staging environments:** 6 hours (standard monitoring)
- **Mixed environments:** 4-6 hours (balanced check frequency)

---

## Error Handling

- **`## Arness` config missing:** Suggest running `arn-infra-wizard` to get started. Stop.
- **No TTL sources available:** If there is no issue tracker, no TTL registry, and no resource manifest, inform the user: "No TTL tracking is configured. Deploy ephemeral resources with `arn-infra-deploy` (which creates cleanup issues) or manually add resources to `.arness/infra/ttl-registry.md`." Stop.
- **Resource manifest missing:** Check other TTL sources (issues, registry). If found, proceed with those. If the manifest should exist, warn: "Resource manifest not found at [path]. Resource tracking may be incomplete."
- **Issue tracker unavailable:** Skip Source 1, proceed with Sources 2 and 3. Note: "Issue tracker was not reachable. Checking TTL registry and resource manifest only."
- **Destroy command fails:** Report the error with the full error output. Offer to retry or skip. Do NOT mark the resource as destroyed if the destroy command failed. Update the issue/registry with the failure.
- **Destroy partially succeeds (multi-resource teardown):** Report which resources were destroyed and which failed. Update tracking for successful destructions only. Present the failures for manual intervention.
- **State lock prevents destruction:** If the IaC state is locked, warn: "Cannot destroy resources -- state is locked by [details]. Wait for the lock to release or force-unlock." Never force-unlock without user confirmation.
- **Resource already destroyed (outside of Arness):** If a resource listed in the manifest no longer exists at the provider, mark it as `destroyed` in the manifest and close any associated cleanup issue. Inform the user: "[resource] was already destroyed (possibly manually or by another process)."
- **TTL registry file does not exist:** Skip Source 2 silently. The TTL registry is optional.
- **Re-running is safe:** Re-running scans all TTL sources again. Already-destroyed resources are skipped (status is `destroyed` in manifest). Closed issues are filtered out by the open-issues query.
