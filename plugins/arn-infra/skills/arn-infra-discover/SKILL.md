# Arness Infra Discover

Proactively audit installed infrastructure tools (MCPs, CLIs, Claude Code plugins), check authentication state, search online for new official tools, generate installation recommendations, and produce a tooling manifest. This is the second step after `arn-infra-init` -- it ensures the user has the right tools configured before generating infrastructure code.

This skill is proactive: it does not just check what is installed, but actively recommends what should be installed based on the user's provider configuration. It distinguishes between official (first-party from the cloud provider) and community tools, prioritizing official tools in recommendations.

## Prerequisites

Read `## Arness` from the project's CLAUDE.md. If no `## Arness` section exists or Arness Infra fields are missing, inform the user: "Arness Infra is not configured for this project yet. Run `arn-infra-wizard` to get started — it will set everything up automatically." Do not proceed without it.

Extract:
- **Providers** -- which providers to discover tools for
- **Default IaC tool** -- which IaC tooling to check
- **Experience level** -- derived from user profile. Read `~/.arness/user-profile.yaml` (or `.claude/arness-profile.local.md` if it exists — project override takes precedence). Apply the experience derivation mapping from `<arn-infra-plugin-root>/skills/arn-infra-ensure-config/references/experience-derivation.md`. If no profile exists, check for legacy `Experience level` in `## Arness` as fallback.
- **Tooling manifest** -- path where the manifest will be written

## Workflow

### Phase A: Detect Installed Tools

For each provider in the `Providers` list, check what is already installed.

> Read the local override or plugin default for `mcp-registry.md`.
> Read the local override or plugin default for `cli-registry.md`.
> Read the local override or plugin default for `plugin-registry.md`.

*The three registry files above are evolving references (read from the user's local `.arness/infra-references/` override if it exists, otherwise from the plugin default). The tooling manifest schema referenced in Phase D is a static reference always read directly from the plugin.*

**A.1. MCP Detection:**
- Read the project's `.mcp.json` for configured MCP servers
- Cross-reference with the curated `mcp-registry.md` to identify known provider MCPs
- For each found MCP, record: name, provider, official status, capabilities

**A.2. CLI Detection:**
- For each provider and IaC tool, run detection commands from `cli-registry.md`:
  - Provider CLIs: `aws --version`, `gcloud --version`, `az --version`, `doctl version`, `fly version`, `vercel --version`, `netlify --version`, `railway version`, `scw version`, `wrangler --version`
  - IaC CLIs: `tofu --version`, `terraform --version`, `pulumi version`, `cdk --version`
  - Validation tools: `checkov --version`, `trivy --version`, `infracost --version`
  - Security scanners: `trufflehog --version`, `gitleaks version`
- For each found CLI, record: name, version, provider, official status

**A.3. Authentication Check:**
- For each detected CLI, run auth-check commands:
  - AWS: `aws sts get-caller-identity`
  - GCP: `gcloud auth list`
  - Azure: `az account show`
  - DigitalOcean: `doctl account get`
  - Fly.io: `fly auth whoami`
  - Vercel: `vercel whoami`
  - Netlify: `netlify status`
- Record auth status: authenticated | not authenticated | unknown

**A.4. Terraform License Check:**
- If `terraform` is found without `tofu`: flag the BSL licensing issue and recommend OpenTofu migration
- If both `terraform` and `tofu` are found: note both, recommend using `tofu`

**A.5. Plugin Detection:**
- Check for known Claude Code provider plugins from `plugin-registry.md`
- Record: name, provider, official status, installed status

---

### Phase B: Online Check for New Official Tools (WebSearch)

For each provider in the user's configuration, use WebSearch to check for:

1. **Official MCP servers** not in the curated registry:
   - Search: `"[provider]" official MCP server "Claude Code"` or `"[provider]" MCP server npm`
2. **Official Claude Code plugins:**
   - Search: `"[provider]" Claude Code plugin official`
3. **New CLIs or CLI updates** with structured output:
   - Search: `"[provider]" CLI latest version features`

**Important constraints:**
- Focus exclusively on **official, first-party tools** from the cloud provider themselves
- Do not recommend community or third-party tools in this phase
- Cross-reference findings with Phase A results to avoid duplicates
- If a new official tool is found not in the curated registry, flag it as a new discovery

---

### Phase C: Proactive Installation Recommendations

Compare what is installed (Phase A) with what is available (registries + Phase B) to produce recommendations.

For each tool category (MCP, CLI, Plugin, IaC, Validation) relevant to the user's providers:

**MCPs not installed:**
"The official [Provider] MCP server is available but not configured. It enables [capabilities]. Install: `[install command]` and add to `.mcp.json`:"
```json
{
  "[provider]-mcp": {
    "command": "[command]",
    "args": ["[args]"]
  }
}
```
Offer to auto-add to `.mcp.json` with user approval.

**CLIs not installed:**
"The official [Provider] CLI (`[binary]`) is not installed. It enables [capabilities]. Install: `[install command for user's OS]`."

**Claude Code plugins not installed:**
"The official [Provider] Claude Code plugin (`[plugin-name]`) is available. It handles [operations] and Arness Infra can delegate to it."

**IaC/validation tools not installed:**
Same pattern -- detect what is missing from the chosen workflow, recommend with install commands.

**Priority tagging:**
- **Required:** Blocks a workflow step (e.g., `tofu` binary missing when IaC tool is `opentofu`)
- **Recommended:** Significantly improves the workflow (e.g., official MCP available, security scanner)
- **Optional:** Nice-to-have enhancement (e.g., Infracost for cost estimation)

For tools tagged **Required**, warn: "Without [tool], Arness Infra cannot perform [operation]. Install it before proceeding."

### Phase D: Produce Tooling Manifest and Present Summary

> Read `<arn-infra-plugin-root>/skills/arn-infra-discover/references/tooling-manifest-schema.md` for the manifest JSON schema.

**D.1. Write tooling manifest:**
Write `tooling-manifest.json` to the path configured in `## Arness` (default: `.arness/infra/tooling-manifest.json`).

The manifest includes:
- **Installed tools** per provider with confidence ratings
- **Recommended tools** not yet installed with install commands and priority

**Confidence ratings** per provider:
- **A:** Official MCP + CLI + authenticated
- **B:** CLI + authenticated (no MCP)
- **C:** CLI installed but not authenticated
- **D:** No direct tooling (config generation only)

**Exception:** If an official Claude Code plugin is installed for a provider, the confidence is at least B regardless of other tooling.

**D.2. Present summary to the user in two sections.**

Adapt output detail to experience level:

- **Expert:** Show raw version details, CLI paths, and configuration snippets.
- **Intermediate:** Show tool names, versions, and brief usage notes.
- **Beginner:** Show simplified output with plain-language explanations of what each tool does and why it matters.



**Section 1: Installed and Ready**

| Tool | Type | Provider | Version | Auth Status | Official |
|------|------|----------|---------|-------------|----------|
| ... | MCP/CLI/Plugin | ... | ... | Yes/No | Yes/No |

**Section 2: Recommended Installations**

| Tool | Type | Provider | Official | Priority | Install Command | What It Enables |
|------|------|----------|----------|----------|-----------------|-----------------|
| ... | MCP/CLI/Plugin | ... | Yes/No | Required/Recommended/Optional | ... | ... |

**D.3. Show per-provider confidence:**

| Provider | Confidence | Reason |
|----------|------------|--------|
| aws | A | Official MCP + AWS CLI authenticated |
| vercel | B | Vercel CLI authenticated, no MCP |
| ... | ... | ... |

**D.4. Auto-configure MCP offers:**
For each recommended MCP:

Ask the user:

**"Would you like me to add the [Provider] MCP to your `.mcp.json`?"**

Options:
1. **Yes** -- Add the MCP configuration entry
2. **No** -- Skip this MCP

If approved, add the MCP configuration entry to the project's `.mcp.json`.

**D.5. Update providers.md:**
Update each provider's `Confidence` rating in `.arness/infra/providers.md` based on the discovery results.

---

## Error Handling

- **`## Arness` config missing:** Suggest running `arn-infra-wizard` to get started. Stop.
- **CLI detection command fails:** Record the tool as "not installed." Do not crash on individual detection failures.
- **Auth check fails:** Record as "not authenticated." Suggest the auth command (e.g., `aws configure`, `gcloud auth login`).
- **WebSearch unavailable:** Skip Phase B. Note in the summary: "Online check skipped -- WebSearch not available. Results are based on curated registries only."
- **`.mcp.json` does not exist:** Create it if the user approves an MCP auto-add. Start with `{}`.
- **Tooling manifest path does not exist:** Create the directory: `mkdir -p` the parent path.
- **All tools missing for a provider:** Lower the confidence to D and strongly recommend at least the CLI. If the user is a beginner, suggest switching to a PaaS provider with simpler tooling.
- **Re-running is safe:** Discovery overwrites the tooling manifest with current state. No data is lost.
