# Arness Infra Change Plan

Generate a phased implementation plan from an infrastructure change specification by invoking the `arn-infra-change-planner` agent. The plan is written to disk as a PLAN_PREVIEW file, presented to the user for review, and iteratively refined based on feedback until approved. The approved plan then feeds into `arn-infra-save-plan` for structuring into phases, tasks, and reports.

This skill plans in infrastructure terms -- phases are ordered by provisioning dependency, blast radius classification, rollback checkpoint placement, and environment promotion gates -- not by application development concepts.

Pipeline position:
arn-infra-init -> arn-infra-change-spec -> [arn-infra-change-plan] -> arn-infra-save-plan -> arn-infra-execute-change -> arn-infra-review-change -> arn-infra-document-change

## Prerequisites

Read `## Arness` from the project's CLAUDE.md. If no `## Arness` section exists or Arness Infra fields are missing, inform the user: "Arness Infra is not configured for this project yet. Run `arn-infra-wizard` to get started — it will set everything up automatically." Do not proceed without it.

Check the **Deferred** field. If `Deferred: yes`, inform the user: "Infrastructure is in deferred mode. Change planning is not available until infrastructure is fully configured. Run `arn-infra-assess` to un-defer." Stop.

Extract:
- **Infra specs directory** -- path where INFRA_CHANGE_*.md specs are stored (default: `.arness/infra-specs`)
- **Infra plans directory** -- path where plans are stored (default: `.arness/infra-plans`)
- **Experience level** -- derived from user profile. Read `~/.arness/user-profile.yaml` (or `.claude/arness-profile.local.md` if it exists — project override takes precedence). Apply the experience derivation mapping from `<arn-infra-plugin-root>/skills/arn-infra-ensure-config/references/experience-derivation.md`. If no profile exists, check for legacy `Experience level` in `## Arness` as fallback.
- **Providers** -- which cloud providers are configured
- **Environments** -- which environments exist and their promotion order

If `Infra plans directory` is not configured, use the default `.arness/infra-plans`. If the directory does not exist, create it: `mkdir -p <infra-plans-dir>`.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Find the Change Specification

The user may provide a spec name as an argument (e.g., "plan infra change migrate-database-managed" or "arn infra plan INFRA_CHANGE_vpc-restructure").

**If an argument was provided:**
- Look for `<infra-specs-dir>/<argument>.md` (exact match)
- If not found, try `<infra-specs-dir>/INFRA_CHANGE_<argument>.md`
- If not found, try matching files in `<infra-specs-dir>/` that contain the argument text in their filename
- If still not found, list available specs and ask the user to choose

**If no argument was provided:**
- List all `INFRA_CHANGE_*.md` files in `<infra-specs-dir>/`
- If only one exists, use it automatically
- If multiple exist, show the list sorted by modification date (most recent first) and ask the user to choose
- If none exist, inform the user: "No infrastructure change specifications found in `<infra-specs-dir>/`. Run `arn-infra-change-spec` to create one first."

---

### Step 2: Load Context

Read these files:
1. The selected specification file (INFRA_CHANGE_*.md)
2. The blast radius guide for classification reference:
   > Read `<arn-infra-plugin-root>/skills/arn-infra-change-spec/references/blast-radius-guide.md`

If the spec file cannot be read, inform the user and stop.

---

### Step 3: Invoke the Change Planner Agent

Derive the spec name from the spec filename (strip prefix and extension):
- `INFRA_CHANGE_migrate-database-managed.md` -> `migrate-database-managed`
- `INFRA_CHANGE_vpc-restructure.md` -> `vpc-restructure`

The output file path is: `<infra-plans-dir>/PLAN_PREVIEW_INFRA_<spec-name>.md`

**Check for existing PLAN_PREVIEW:** If a PLAN_PREVIEW file already exists at that path, inform the user: "A plan preview already exists for this spec: `<path>`."

Ask the user:

**"A plan preview already exists. What would you like to do?"**

Options:
1. **Regenerate** -- Generate a new plan from scratch
2. **Review** -- Review the existing plan

If **Review**, skip to Step 4. If **Regenerate**, proceed.

Invoke the `arn-infra-change-planner` agent via the Task tool, passing the model from `.arness/agent-models/infra.md` as the `model` parameter (see `plugins/arn-infra/skills/arn-infra-ensure-config/references/ensure-config.md` "Dispatch convention" for fallback). Context:

```text
You are generating a phased infrastructure implementation plan for the following change specification.

**Specification:** <spec-name>
**Spec file:** <infra-specs-dir>/<spec-filename>

--- CHANGE SPEC ---
[full spec file content]
--- END CHANGE SPEC ---

--- PROVIDER CONFIG ---
Providers: [from ## Arness]
Default IaC tool: [from ## Arness, if configured]
--- END PROVIDER CONFIG ---

--- ENVIRONMENT CONFIG ---
Environments: [from ## Arness]
Promotion order: [from ## Arness or from the spec's Environment Scope section]
--- END ENVIRONMENT CONFIG ---

--- OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS ---
Output file: <infra-plans-dir>/PLAN_PREVIEW_INFRA_<spec-name>.md

Generate a phased implementation plan structured by:
1. Provisioning dependency order (network before compute, compute before application)
2. Blast radius classification per phase (lowest to highest where possible)
3. Rollback checkpoint placement (before data-involved phases, before network changes, before cross-environment promotions)
4. Environment promotion gates (sequential: dev -> staging -> production, with explicit gates)
5. Cost budgeting per phase (estimated delta, cumulative tracking)
6. Parallel execution opportunities (independent resources within the same environment)

Include `Spec: <infra-specs-dir>/<spec-filename>` near the top for linkage.

Write the plan to the output file.
--- END OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS ---
```

---

### Step 4: Present Plan and Feedback Loop

After the planner agent completes:

1. Read the generated plan from `<infra-plans-dir>/PLAN_PREVIEW_INFRA_<spec-name>.md`
2. Present a structured summary to the user, adapted by experience level:

**Expert:**
Concise summary with phase table:

| Phase | Environment | Blast Radius | Resources | Cost Delta | Depends On |
|-------|-------------|-------------|-----------|------------|------------|
| [N] | [env] | [classification] | [N] create, [N] modify, [N] destroy | [amount] | [phases] |

**Intermediate:**
Phase list with brief descriptions and key decisions:

"**Phase [N]: [title]**
- Environment: [env]
- Blast radius: [classification]
- Resources: [list]
- Rollback checkpoint: [yes/no -- what is checkpointed]
- Cost: [delta]"

**Beginner:**
Narrative walkthrough explaining each phase in plain language, what it does, and why it is ordered this way.

3. Ask: **"Does this plan look right, or would you like to change anything?"**

**If the user approves** (e.g., "looks good", "approved", "yes", "proceed"):
Go to Step 5.

**If the user provides feedback** (e.g., "combine phases 2 and 3", "add a rollback checkpoint before phase 4", "move the DNS change to a separate phase"):
Go to Step 4b.

#### Step 4b: Iterate with Feedback

Invoke a fresh `arn-infra-change-planner` agent via the Task tool, passing the model from `.arness/agent-models/infra.md` as the `model` parameter (see `plugins/arn-infra/skills/arn-infra-ensure-config/references/ensure-config.md` "Dispatch convention" for fallback). Context (the current plan and user feedback):

```text
You are revising an existing infrastructure implementation plan based on user feedback.

**Current plan file:** <infra-plans-dir>/PLAN_PREVIEW_INFRA_<spec-name>.md
**Spec file:** <infra-specs-dir>/<spec-filename>

--- USER FEEDBACK ---
[user's feedback verbatim]
--- END USER FEEDBACK ---

Read the current plan from the plan file, apply the user's feedback, and write
the updated plan to the same file. Summarize what you changed.
```

After the agent completes, return to Step 4 (read updated plan, present summary, ask for approval).

---

### Step 5: Plan Approved

Confirm with the user:

"Plan approved and saved to `<infra-plans-dir>/PLAN_PREVIEW_INFRA_<spec-name>.md`.

Next step: Run `arn-infra-save-plan` to convert this plan into a structured project with phased implementation tasks and infrastructure-specific report templates."

## Error Handling

- **`## Arness` config missing:** Suggest running `arn-infra-wizard` to get started. Stop.
- **No change specs found:** Suggest running `arn-infra-change-spec` first. Stop.
- **Infra plans directory does not exist:** Create it with `mkdir -p`. Continue.
- **Change planner agent fails or crashes:** Read the agent's output to identify what went wrong. If a partial plan was written, present it and ask the user if they want to retry or edit manually: "The planner encountered an issue. A partial plan was written. Would you like me to retry, or would you prefer to edit the partial plan manually?"
- **Change planner returns empty output:** Inform: "The planner could not generate a plan from the specification. This may mean the spec is incomplete. Review the spec and try again, or provide additional context." Offer to re-run `arn-infra-change-spec` to refine the spec.
- **Agent invocation fails during feedback loop:** Report the error. Offer to retry or let the user edit the plan file manually.
- **PLAN_PREVIEW file not written by agent:** Check the agent output for errors. If the agent produced plan content but did not write it, write the content to the PLAN_PREVIEW file directly and continue.
- **User cancels:** Confirm cancellation. If a PLAN_PREVIEW file was partially written, inform the user of its location so they can delete or edit it manually.
- **Re-running is safe:** Regenerating a plan overwrites the existing PLAN_PREVIEW file after explicit confirmation. The change spec is not modified.
