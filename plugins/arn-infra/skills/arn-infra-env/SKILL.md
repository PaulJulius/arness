# Arness Infra Env

Configure and manage infrastructure environments (dev, staging, production) with provider-specific isolation strategies, environment-specific variable overrides, resource sizing, and promotion rules. This skill generates environment-specific IaC configurations and updates the environment promotion pipeline.

This skill is expertise-adaptive: beginner users get simplified environment setups with opinionated defaults, while expert users have full control over isolation strategies and promotion configurations.

## Prerequisites

Read `## Arness` from the project's CLAUDE.md. If no `## Arness` section exists or Arness Infra fields are missing, inform the user: "Arness Infra is not configured for this project yet. Run `/arn-infra-wizard` to get started — it will set everything up automatically." Do not proceed without it.

Check the **Deferred** field. If `Deferred: yes`, inform the user: "Infrastructure is in deferred mode. Environment management is not available until infrastructure is fully configured. Run `/arn-infra-assess` to un-defer." Stop.

Extract:
- **Experience level** -- derived from user profile. Read `~/.arness/user-profile.yaml` (or `.claude/arness-profile.local.md` if it exists — project override takes precedence). Apply the experience derivation mapping from `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/arn-infra-ensure-config/references/experience-derivation.md`. If no profile exists, check for legacy `Experience level` in `## Arness` as fallback.
- **Providers** -- cloud providers in use
- **Providers config** -- path to `providers.md` for per-provider details
- **Default IaC tool** -- the default IaC tool
- **Environments** -- current environment list in promotion order
- **Environments config** -- path to `environments.md`

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Read Current Environment Configuration

Read the environment configuration:

```
Read <environments-config-path>
```

Extract the current state:
- Promotion pipeline order
- Per-environment settings (auto-deploy, approval required, last deployed, pending changes)

Read the provider configuration:

```
Read <providers-config-path>
```

Extract per-provider scope and IaC tool for environment-specific config generation.

**Present current state:**
"Your current environment pipeline: [env1] --> [env2] --> [env3]

| Environment | Auto-deploy | Approval | Last deployed |
|-------------|-------------|----------|---------------|
[table of environments]"

Ask (using `AskUserQuestion`):

**"What would you like to do?"**

Options:
1. **Full environment setup** -- Run through all environment tasks sequentially
2. **Specific task** -- Choose a specific environment task

If **Full environment setup**: proceed through Steps 2-5 sequentially, pausing for user confirmation at each decision point.

If **Specific task**:

Ask (using `AskUserQuestion`):

**"Which task?"**

Options:
1. **Add environment** -- Add a new environment to the pipeline
2. **Configure environment** -- Set up isolation, variables, and sizing
3. **Configure promotion** -- Set up or update promotion rules between environments
4. **Generate configs** -- Generate environment-specific IaC configurations

Route each specific task to its corresponding step: Add environment maps to Step 2, Configure environment maps to Step 3, Configure promotion maps to Step 5, Generate configs maps to Step 4.

---

### Step 2: Environment Isolation Strategy

> Read the local override or plugin default for `environment-patterns.md`.

For each provider, recommend an isolation strategy based on experience level:

**Expert:**
Present all isolation options with trade-offs and let the user choose:

Ask (using `AskUserQuestion`):

**"For [provider], choose your isolation strategy:"**

Options:
1. **Account/project separation** -- Strongest isolation, separate billing, higher overhead
2. **VPC/network separation** -- Good isolation within same account, shared billing
3. **Namespace separation** -- Lightweight, shared resources, weakest isolation
4. **Resource naming** -- Minimal isolation, environments share everything

**Intermediate:**
Present the recommended option with a brief alternative:
"For [provider], I recommend [strategy] because [rationale]. An alternative would be [other option] which trades [trade-off]."

**Beginner:**
Make the recommendation directly:
"For [provider], I'll use [simplest appropriate strategy]. This gives you separate environments without extra complexity."

---

### Step 3: Environment-Specific Variables and Sizing

For each environment, configure:

**Variable overrides:**
- Instance sizes (e.g., `t3.micro` for dev, `t3.medium` for staging, `t3.large` for prod)
- Replica counts (e.g., 1 for dev, 2 for staging, 3 for prod)
- Database tiers (e.g., `db.t3.micro` for dev, `db.r6g.large` for prod)
- Feature flags (e.g., debug mode on for dev, off for prod)
- Domain names and URLs per environment
- Log levels and retention periods

**Resource sizing guidance per experience level:**

**Expert:** Ask for specific resource specifications per environment.

**Intermediate:** Suggest a sizing matrix and ask for approval:
"Here's a recommended sizing matrix:
| Resource | Dev | Staging | Prod |
|----------|-----|---------|------|
| Compute | [small] | [medium] | [large] |
| Database | [small] | [medium] | [large] |
| Replicas | 1 | 2 | 3 |
Adjust as needed."

**Beginner:** Apply defaults automatically:
"I'll use small resources for dev, medium for staging, and appropriately sized resources for production. This keeps costs low during development."

---

### Step 4: Generate Environment-Specific IaC Configurations

Based on the IaC tool, generate environment-specific configuration files:

| IaC Tool | Config Format | Example |
|----------|--------------|---------|
| OpenTofu / Terraform | `environments/<env>.tfvars` | `instance_type = "t3.small"` |
| Pulumi | `Pulumi.<env>.yaml` stack config | `config: app:instanceType: t3.small` |
| CDK | Environment props in `cdk.json` or separate env file | `{ "env": { "account": "...", "region": "..." } }` |
| Bicep | `environments/<env>.parameters.json` | `{ "parameters": { "instanceType": { "value": "..." } } }` |
| Kubernetes | `environments/<env>/kustomization.yaml` or `values-<env>.yaml` | Kustomize overlays or Helm value overrides |
| PaaS (none) | Platform-native env config | Environment-specific sections in `fly.toml`, `vercel.json` |

Invoke the `arn-infra-specialist` agent via the Task tool, passing the model from `.arness/agent-models/infra.md` as the `model` parameter (see `plugins/arn-infra/skills/arn-infra-ensure-config/references/ensure-config.md` "Dispatch convention" for fallback). Context:

--- ENVIRONMENT CONTEXT ---
Environments: [list in promotion order]
[For each environment:]
Environment: [name]
Isolation strategy: [strategy]
Variable overrides: [key-value pairs]
Resource sizing: [specifications]
--- END ENVIRONMENT CONTEXT ---

--- PROVIDER CONFIGURATION ---
[For each provider:]
Provider: [name]
IaC tool: [tool]
Scope: [components]
--- END PROVIDER CONFIGURATION ---

--- INFRASTRUCTURE CONFIG ---
Experience level: [derived from user profile]
--- END INFRASTRUCTURE CONFIG ---

--- INSTRUCTIONS ---
Generate environment-specific configuration files for each environment and provider combination.

For each environment:
1. Generate the appropriate config file format for the IaC tool
2. Include all variable overrides (instance sizes, replicas, domains, feature flags)
3. Include environment-specific tags/labels for resource identification
4. Reference shared modules/resources -- environments differ only in configuration values

Follow these rules:
- Adapt comment verbosity and configuration complexity to the experience level
- Never hardcode secrets in config files -- use variable references or secret manager
- Include comments explaining environment-specific choices
- For the production environment, include higher-availability settings (multi-AZ, auto-scaling)
- For development, optimize for cost (smallest viable resources, single-AZ)
--- END INSTRUCTIONS ---

---

### Step 5: Configure Promotion Rules

> Read the local override or plugin default for `promotion-patterns.md`.

Configure the promotion pipeline between environments:

**Default promotion rules:**
- **Dev** --> Auto-deploy on merge to development branch
- **Staging** --> Manual trigger (or auto-deploy on merge to main)
- **Production** --> Manual trigger with approval gate

For each promotion step, configure:
- Trigger method (auto-deploy, manual trigger, scheduled)
- Approval requirements (none, single reviewer, team approval)
- Deployment strategy (rolling update, blue-green, canary)
- Rollback policy (auto-rollback on health check failure, manual rollback)

**Expert:** Present all strategy options and let the user choose per transition.

**Intermediate:** Recommend rolling updates with manual approval for production:
"I recommend auto-deploying to staging on merge, with manual approval and rolling updates for production. Would you like to adjust?"

**Beginner:** Apply safe defaults:
"I'll set up auto-deploy to staging when you merge code, and manual approval before deploying to production. This gives you a safety net."

---

### Step 6: Update Configuration

Update `environments.md` with the configured environments:

```markdown
# Environments

## Promotion Pipeline
[env1] --> [env2] --> [env3]

## [environment-name]
- **Isolation:** [strategy]
- **Auto-deploy:** [yes | no]
- **Approval required:** [yes | no]
- **Deploy strategy:** [rolling | blue-green | canary]
- **Rollback policy:** [auto | manual]
- **Last deployed:** --
- **Pending changes:** none
```

Update `## Arness` in CLAUDE.md with the finalized environment list if it has changed:
- Update the **Environments** field with the new comma-separated list

---

### Step 7: Present Summary and Next Steps

**Environment Configuration Summary:**
- **Environments:** [list with isolation strategies]
- **Promotion pipeline:** [env1 --> env2 --> env3]
- **Config files created:** [list with paths]
- **Promotion rules:** [summary per transition]

**Recommended next steps:**

"Environments are configured. Here is the recommended path:

1. **Set up CI/CD:** Run `/arn-infra-pipeline` to generate environment-aware deployment pipelines
2. **Manage secrets:** Run `/arn-infra-secrets` to configure per-environment secrets
3. **Deploy:** Run `/arn-infra-deploy` to deploy to your first environment

Or run `/arn-infra-wizard` for the full guided pipeline."

---

## Error Handling

- **`## Arness` config missing:** Suggest running `/arn-infra-wizard` to get started. Stop.
- **No providers configured:** Suggest running `/arn-infra-init` to configure providers. Stop.
- **No IaC tool selected:** If the default IaC tool is `none` and no per-provider IaC tools are configured, skip IaC config generation. Inform the user that platform-native environment configurations will be used.
- **Specialist agent fails:** Report the error. Fall back to generating basic environment config files directly using the loaded reference patterns. Present with a note: "Generated using fallback patterns -- review carefully."
- **Specialist agent returns empty output:** Inform the user and retry with additional context. If retry fails, generate minimal config files with placeholder values.
- **Isolation strategy not supported for provider:** Fall back to the next best option. For example, if separate accounts are not feasible, suggest VPC separation with a note explaining the trade-off.
- **Environment already exists:** Present the existing configuration and offer to update it. Do not create duplicates.
- **Re-running is safe:** Re-running presents the current state and offers update options. Existing config files are shown in a diff before overwriting. The environments.md file is updated, not duplicated.
