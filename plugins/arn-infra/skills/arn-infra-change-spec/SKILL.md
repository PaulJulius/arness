# Arness Infra Change Spec

Develop an infrastructure change idea into a well-formed specification through iterative conversation, aided by the `arn-infra-request-analyzer` and `arn-infra-cost-analyst` agents. This is a conversational skill that runs in normal conversation (NOT plan mode). The primary artifact is an **infrastructure change specification** written to the project's infra specs directory that captures affected resources, blast radius, environment scope, rollback requirements, compliance constraints, and cost impact. The spec then informs plan creation via `/arn-infra-change-plan`.

This skill supports two entry paths:
- **Fresh:** Guide the user through an iterative conversation to develop the change from scratch
- **Upgrade from interactive:** Accept existing IaC artifacts or resource manifests produced by interactive skills (define, containerize, deploy) and build a structured spec around them

Pipeline position:
arn-infra-init -> arn-infra-wizard (Full Pipeline) -> [arn-infra-change-spec] -> arn-infra-change-plan -> arn-infra-save-plan -> arn-infra-execute-change -> arn-infra-review-change -> arn-infra-document-change

## Prerequisites

Read `## Arness` from the project's CLAUDE.md. If no `## Arness` section exists or Arness Infra fields are missing, inform the user: "Arness Infra is not configured for this project yet. Run `/arn-infra-wizard` to get started — it will set everything up automatically." Do not proceed without it.

Check the **Deferred** field. If `Deferred: yes`, inform the user: "Infrastructure is in deferred mode. Change specification is not available until infrastructure is fully configured. Run `/arn-infra-assess` to un-defer." Stop.

Extract:
- **Infra specs directory** -- path where INFRA_CHANGE_*.md specs are stored (default: `.arness/infra-specs`)
- **Experience level** -- derived from user profile. Read `~/.arness/user-profile.yaml` (or `.claude/arness-profile.local.md` if it exists — project override takes precedence). Apply the experience derivation mapping from `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/arn-infra-ensure-config/references/experience-derivation.md`. If no profile exists, check for legacy `Experience level` in `## Arness` as fallback.
- **Providers** -- which cloud providers are configured
- **Environments** -- which environments exist and their promotion order
- **Cost threshold** -- budget threshold for cost impact warnings

If `Infra specs directory` is not configured, use the default `.arness/infra-specs`. If the directory does not exist, create it: `mkdir -p <infra-specs-dir>`.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Determine Entry Path

Analyze the user's trigger message and project state to determine which entry path to follow.

**Upgrade detection:**
Check for signals that the user wants to upgrade existing interactive work to the pipeline:
- User explicitly says "upgrade to pipeline", "convert to pipeline", or "upgrade from interactive"
- User references existing IaC artifacts: "I already defined infrastructure", "I used arn-infra-define", "upgrade my existing infrastructure"
- Existing IaC files are present and the user references them

**If upgrade signals are detected:** Go to Step 2a (Upgrade Path).

**If no upgrade signals:** Go to Step 2b (Fresh Path).

---

### Step 2a: Upgrade from Interactive Path

This path accepts existing IaC artifacts produced by interactive skills and builds a structured change spec around them.

1. **Locate existing artifacts:**
   - Check for IaC files in the project (`.tf`, `Pulumi.*`, `cdk.json`, `*.bicep`, `fly.toml`, `docker-compose.yml`, Kubernetes manifests, platform configs)
   - Check for resource manifests (`active-resources.json`, `tooling-manifest.json`)
   - Check for existing provider configuration (`.arness/infra/providers.md`)

2. **Present findings to the user:**

   "I found the following existing infrastructure artifacts:

   | Artifact | Type | Provider | Path |
   |----------|------|----------|------|
   | ... | IaC/Config/Manifest | ... | ... |

   I'll build a change specification around these. This captures the change formally so it can go through the structured pipeline (plan, execute, review, document)."

3. **Extract infrastructure context from artifacts:**
   - Read the IaC files to identify resources being created, modified, or configured
   - Read provider configuration for environment and provider details
   - Read any existing specs or briefs in the infra specs directory

4. **Proceed to Step 3** with the extracted context as the initial change description. Skip the iterative idea capture -- the artifacts define what is changing.

---

### Step 2b: Fresh Path

Guide the user through developing the change idea from scratch.

Ask the user to describe their infrastructure change. Accept anything from a single sentence to a detailed description. Do not require a specific format.

If the user already provided the change idea in their trigger message (e.g., "infra change spec: migrate the database to a managed service"), use that directly without asking again.

Acknowledge the idea with a brief restatement to confirm understanding.

**Prompt questions to fill gaps** (adapt to experience level):

**Expert:** Ask targeted questions only for genuinely missing information. Trust the user to provide sufficient detail.

**Intermediate:** Ask 3-5 structured questions covering the key areas:
- "Which resources are affected and what operations (create/modify/destroy)?"
- "Which environments does this change target?"
- "Are there rollback constraints or compliance requirements?"
- "What is the expected cost impact?"

**Beginner:** Walk through each area with explanations:
- "Let's start with what needs to change. Can you describe the resources involved? (For example: a database, a load balancer, a DNS record...)"
- "Which environments will this affect? (For example: just development, or also staging and production?)"
- "If something goes wrong, how would you want to undo this change?"
- "Are there any budget limits or compliance rules to consider?"

---

### Step 3: Load References and Analyze

> Read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/arn-infra-change-spec/references/infra-change-spec-template.md` for the spec template.

> Read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/arn-infra-change-spec/references/blast-radius-guide.md` for blast radius classification.

Using the change description (from Step 2a or 2b), perform initial analysis:

1. **Classify blast radius** per environment using the blast-radius-guide classifications (None/Contained/Broad/Critical)
2. **Identify affected resources** with provider, action (create/modify/destroy), and environment scope
3. **Assess rollback complexity** based on the types of changes involved
4. **Estimate cost impact** direction (increase/decrease/neutral) and rough magnitude

---

### Step 4: Invoke Agents for Deep Analysis

**If application context is available** (the change is driven by an application feature, or cross-project artifacts exist):

Invoke the `arn-infra-request-analyzer` agent via the Task tool, passing the model from `.arness/agent-models/infra.md` as the `model` parameter (see `plugins/arn-infra/skills/arn-infra-ensure-config/references/ensure-config.md` "Dispatch convention" for fallback). Context:

```text
--- CHANGE CONTEXT ---
[change description from Step 2a or 2b]
--- END CHANGE CONTEXT ---

--- INFRASTRUCTURE CONFIG ---
Providers: [from ## Arness]
Environments: [from ## Arness]
Experience level: [derived from user profile]
--- END INFRASTRUCTURE CONFIG ---

--- INSTRUCTIONS ---
Analyze the infrastructure implications of this change. Identify all affected
resources, dependencies between resources, and potential impacts on existing
infrastructure. Focus on what needs to change and what could break.
--- END INSTRUCTIONS ---
```

**Always invoke the `arn-infra-cost-analyst` agent** for preliminary cost estimation:

```text
--- CHANGE CONTEXT ---
[change description including identified resources and operations]
--- END CHANGE CONTEXT ---

--- COST CONFIG ---
Providers: [from ## Arness]
Cost threshold: [from ## Arness]
--- END COST CONFIG ---

--- INSTRUCTIONS ---
Provide a preliminary cost estimation for this infrastructure change.
Estimate monthly cost delta, one-time provisioning costs, and compare
with the current state. Flag if the estimated cost exceeds the configured
threshold.
--- END INSTRUCTIONS ---
```

Both agents can be invoked in parallel since they are independent.

---

### Step 5: Exploration Phase (Iterative)

This is a conversation loop. Each iteration:

1. **Present findings** -- Show the initial analysis including blast radius classification, affected resources, cost estimate, and any agent outputs.

2. **Listen** -- The user responds with feedback, corrections, additional requirements, or questions.

3. **Refine** -- Update the change specification based on feedback. Re-invoke agents if the scope changes significantly (e.g., new resources added, different environments targeted).

4. **Summarize** -- After each substantive exchange, briefly state where things stand: what has been decided, what is still open.

5. **Check for readiness** -- When the conversation converges (open questions resolved, user is agreeing), ask:

   "I think we have enough to write the change specification. Ready for me to finalize it, or do you want to explore anything else?"

   Use judgment -- typically after 2-4 rounds of substantive discussion, or when the user signals readiness.

---

### Step 6: Write the Change Specification

When the user approves:

1. Derive a kebab-case name for the change from the description (e.g., "migrate database to managed service" -> `migrate-database-managed`). Suggest to the user: "I'll name this spec `<name>`. Good?"

2. Populate the `infra-change-spec-template.md` with all gathered information:
   - Change Overview from the conversation
   - Affected Resources table from analysis
   - Blast Radius Assessment per environment
   - Rollback Requirements from discussion
   - Environment Scope with promotion order
   - Compliance Constraints if identified
   - Cost Impact from the cost-analyst agent
   - Dependencies identified during exploration
   - Acceptance Criteria from the conversation

3. Write to `<infra-specs-dir>/INFRA_CHANGE_<name>.md`.

4. Present a summary:
   - Spec file location
   - Key decisions captured
   - Blast radius classification per environment
   - Cost impact summary
   - Open items remaining

5. Inform the user of next steps:

   "Infrastructure change specification saved to `<infra-specs-dir>/INFRA_CHANGE_<name>.md`.

   Next step: Run `/arn-infra-change-plan` to generate a phased implementation plan from this spec."

## Error Handling

- **`## Arness` config missing:** Suggest running `/arn-infra-wizard` to get started. Stop.
- **Infra specs directory does not exist:** Create it with `mkdir -p`. Continue.
- **Request analyzer agent fails:** Report the error. Continue without cross-project analysis. Note in the spec: "Application context analysis was unavailable. Review affected resources manually."
- **Cost analyst agent fails:** Report the error. Continue without cost estimation. Note in the spec: "Cost estimation was unavailable. Estimate costs before executing the change."
- **Cost analyst returns empty output:** Inform: "The cost analyst could not determine cost impact from the available information. Add cost estimates manually before proceeding."
- **Ambiguous scope:** If the user describes a change that could apply to multiple environments or providers, ask for clarification rather than guessing.
- **Missing provider info:** If the change references a provider not configured in `## Arness`, warn: "Provider [name] is not configured in your Arness Infra setup. Run `/arn-infra-init` to add it, or specify the provider details manually."
- **Existing spec with same name:** If `INFRA_CHANGE_<name>.md` already exists:

  Ask (using `AskUserQuestion`):

  **"A spec with this name already exists. What would you like to do?"**

  Options:
  1. **Overwrite** -- Replace the existing spec
  2. **Rename** -- Choose a different name
- **Re-running is safe:** Creating a new spec does not affect existing specs. The user can create multiple specs for different changes. Overwriting an existing spec requires explicit confirmation.
