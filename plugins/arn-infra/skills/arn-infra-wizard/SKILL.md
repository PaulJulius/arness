# Arness Infra Wizard

Walk the user through the entire Arness infrastructure pipeline in a single continuous session. The wizard invokes each pipeline skill in sequence using the Skill tool, only pausing at genuine decision gates where user input is needed.

This skill is a **sequencer and decision-gate handler**. It MUST NOT duplicate sub-skill logic. All pipeline work is done by the invoked skills. The wizard handles: entry mode detection, transitions between skills, progress display, expertise-adaptive step selection, and artifact-based resumability.

## Step 0: Ensure Configuration

Read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/arn-infra-ensure-config/references/step-0-fast-path.md` and follow its instructions. This guarantees a user profile exists and `## Arness` is configured with Arness Infra fields before proceeding.

After Step 0 completes, read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/arn-infra-ensure-config/references/experience-derivation.md` and derive the user's infrastructure experience level from their profile.

Arness Core is optional but enhances cross-plugin workflows when present. If a `## Arness` section exists with Arness Core fields (plans directory, specs directory, etc.), note the configuration for cross-plugin context. This information may be useful for linking infrastructure changes to application features, but is NOT required.

Extract all `## Arness` config fields for use throughout the wizard:
- **Experience level** -- derived from user profile (see experience-derivation.md). If no profile exists, check for legacy `Experience level` in `## Arness` as fallback.
- **Deferred** -- triggers assessment-driven entry mode
- **Providers config** -- path to `providers.md`
- **Environments config** -- path to `environments.md`
- **Tooling manifest** -- path to `tooling-manifest.json`
- **Resource manifest** -- path to `active-resources.json`
- **Default IaC tool** -- for artifact detection
- **Project topology** -- for context
- **CI/CD platform** -- for CI/CD context (github-actions, gitlab-ci, bitbucket-pipelines, none)
- **Issue tracker** -- for triage entry mode detection

## Mode Selection

After prerequisites, present the user with a mode choice. This determines which pipeline flow the wizard uses for the entire session.

Ask (using `AskUserQuestion`):

**"What type of infrastructure change are you making?"**

Options:
1. **Quick mode** -- Simple, low-risk changes to a single environment. Uses the interactive flow: discover, define, deploy, verify. No planning overhead.
2. **Full pipeline mode** -- Complex, multi-environment, or compliance-sensitive changes. Uses the structured flow: change-spec, change-plan, save-plan, execute-change, review-change, document-change. Includes review gates, cost tracking, and audit trails.

**Mode recommendation logic:**

Analyze the user's change description (if provided) or project context to recommend a mode:
- Single environment + single resource type + low blast radius --> recommend **Quick mode**
- Multi-environment + multiple resources + compliance requirements --> recommend **Full Pipeline mode**
- Existing pipeline artifacts in `.arness/infra-specs/` or `.arness/infra-plans/` --> recommend **Full Pipeline mode** (resume)
- No change description provided --> present both options without recommendation

If the user does not specify, default to Quick mode for beginner experience level and present both options for intermediate/expert.

---

## Entry Mode Detection

After mode selection, detect the appropriate entry mode within the selected mode. Each mode has a set of entry modes checked from most specific to least specific -- first match wins.

**Quick mode entry modes:** Fresh/Resume (default), Triage-driven, Assessment-driven, Migration.
**Full Pipeline entry modes:** Change Pipeline (resume or explicit), New Pipeline (default).

> Read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/arn-infra-wizard/references/entry-modes.md` for the complete entry mode detection rules, conditions, and pipeline sequences.

The workflow steps below (Step 1a, Step 1b) correspond to Entry Mode 2 (Triage-Driven) and Entry Mode 3 (Assessment-Driven) respectively.

## Full Pipeline Mode Flow

> Read ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/arn-infra-wizard/references/full-pipeline-flow.md

---

## Expertise-Adaptive Pipeline

### Expert / Intermediate

Full 10-step pipeline with 8 decision gates (Q1, Q1.5, Q2 through Q7). All steps are presented. Decision gates allow skipping optional steps.

### Beginner

Simplified 6-step pipeline focusing on the essentials:
1. init (already done)
2. discover
3. containerize
4. define
5. deploy
6. verify

Advanced steps (pipeline, env, secrets, monitor) are offered as optional extras after the core pipeline completes:

"The core infrastructure is deployed and verified. These additional steps are optional but recommended for production readiness:
- **CI/CD Pipeline** -- Automate future deployments
- **Environment Management** -- Set up staging/prod promotion
- **Secrets Management** -- Secure your credentials
- **Monitoring** -- Set up health checks and alerting

Ask (using `AskUserQuestion`):

**"Would you like to set up any of these optional features?"**

Options:
1. **All** -- Set up all optional features
2. **Pick individually** -- Choose which features to set up
3. **Skip** -- Skip all optional features

---

## Interactive-to-Pipeline Upgrade Path

At any point during Quick mode, the user may request an upgrade to Full Pipeline mode. Detect upgrade requests when the user says any of: "I want review gates", "upgrade to pipeline", "add audit trail", "switch to full pipeline", "need more structure", or "this is getting complex".

**Upgrade flow:**

1. Acknowledge the upgrade request: "Upgrading to Full Pipeline mode. I will create a structured change specification from your existing progress."
2. Invoke `Skill: arn-infra:arn-infra-change-spec` with the existing artifacts as input context:
   - Pass any IaC files generated by define
   - Pass any deployment results from deploy
   - Pass any verification results from verify
   - Pass the tooling manifest from discover
3. When change-spec completes, continue in Full Pipeline mode from P2 (change-plan) onward.

**Proactive upgrade detection:**

After any Quick mode step completes, check if the change complexity warrants an upgrade. Offer an upgrade if:
- The user has run `arn-infra-define` interactively and the generated IaC touches multiple environments or providers
- The deployment scope has expanded beyond the initial single-environment expectation
- The user mentions compliance, audit, or review requirements

Proactive offer: "I see you have generated IaC code that spans multiple environments. Would you like to wrap this in the structured pipeline for review gates and documentation? (yes / no)"

If the user accepts: follow the upgrade flow above. If the user declines: continue in Quick mode.

## Workflow

### Step 0: Initialize, Select Mode, and Detect Entry Mode

1. Read CLAUDE.md. Check prerequisites (see Prerequisites section).
2. Extract `## Arness` config fields. If `## Arness` section exists, note it for cross-plugin context.
3. Determine expertise level from the profile-derived experience level (see Step 0).
4. Present mode selection (see Mode Selection section). User chooses Quick or Full Pipeline.
5. If **Quick mode**: detect entry mode from Quick mode entry modes (see Entry Mode Detection section).
6. If **Full Pipeline mode**: detect entry mode from Full Pipeline mode entry modes (see Entry Mode Detection section).
7. If Quick mode Fresh/Resume: run artifact detection (see Artifact Detection section).
8. If Full Pipeline mode Change Pipeline: run pipeline artifact detection (see Entry Mode 5).

---

### Step 1: Artifact Check and Gate Q1

**If artifacts detected (Fresh/Resume mode only):**

Show the detected state and ask Q1:

"It looks like you have an in-progress infrastructure pipeline at [detected stage]. Would you like to resume from there, or start fresh?"

- **Resume** -- skip to the detected resume point
- **Start fresh** -- begin at Step 2 (do not delete existing artifacts)

**If no artifacts detected:** skip Q1 and proceed to Step 2.

---

### Step 1a: Triage (Triage-Driven Entry Only)

This step runs only when Entry Mode 2 (Triage-Driven) was detected in Step 0.

Inform the user: "Processing [N] pending infrastructure request(s)..."

> `Skill: arn-infra:arn-infra-triage`

When triage completes, the implications brief is available. Proceed directly to Step 4 (Define) — skip discover and containerize since the triage brief already contains the analyzed requirements.

---

### Step 1b: Assess (Assessment-Driven Entry Only)

This step runs only when Entry Mode 3 (Assessment-Driven) was detected in Step 0.

Inform the user: "Running full infrastructure assessment on deferred backlog..."

> `Skill: arn-infra:arn-infra-assess`

When assess completes, the user has a prioritized infrastructure backlog. Proceed directly to Step 4 (Define) — skip discover and containerize since the assessment has already produced the infrastructure plan.

---

### Step 2: Discover (Automated)

Show progress (Expert/Intermediate):
```
Infra Pipeline: DISCOVER --> containerize --> define --> deploy --> verify --> pipeline --> env --> secrets --> monitor
                ^^^^^^^^
```

Show progress (Beginner):
```
Infra Pipeline: DISCOVER --> containerize --> define --> deploy --> verify
                ^^^^^^^^
```

Inform the user: "Auditing your installed tools, MCPs, and CLIs..."

> `Skill: arn-infra:arn-infra-discover`

When discover completes, `tooling-manifest.json` exists at the Tooling manifest path.

---

### Step 2.5: Gate Q1.5 -- Tool Installation

After discover, check the tooling manifest for tools with `"status": "recommended"` and `"installed": false`.

If missing recommended tools are found, present Q1.5. Otherwise, skip to Step 3.

---

### Step 3: Gate Q2 -- Containerize Decision

Show progress:
```
Infra Pipeline: discover --> CONTAINERIZE --> define --> deploy --> verify --> pipeline --> env --> secrets --> monitor
                              ^^^^^^^^^^^^
```

Ask Q2 (see Decision Gates section).

If **Yes:**
> `Skill: arn-infra:arn-infra-containerize`

If **Skip:** mark containerize as skipped and proceed to Step 4.

---

### Step 4: Define (Automated)

Show progress:
```
Infra Pipeline: discover --> containerize --> DEFINE --> deploy --> verify --> pipeline --> env --> secrets --> monitor
                                              ^^^^^^
```

Inform the user: "Generating infrastructure-as-code configurations..."

> `Skill: arn-infra:arn-infra-define`

When define completes, IaC configuration files exist in the project.

---

### Step 5: Gate Q3 -- Deploy Level

Show progress:
```
Infra Pipeline: discover --> containerize --> define --> DEPLOY --> verify --> pipeline --> env --> secrets --> monitor
                                                         ^^^^^^
```

Ask Q3 (see Decision Gates section).

Based on user choice:

- **Deploy to staging/production:** `Skill: arn-infra:arn-infra-deploy` (pass the target environment as context)
- **Dry run only:** `Skill: arn-infra:arn-infra-deploy` (pass dry-run mode as context)
- **Skip:** mark deploy as skipped, proceed to Step 6

---

### Step 6: Gate Q4 -- Verify and CI/CD

Show progress:
```
Infra Pipeline: discover --> containerize --> define --> deploy --> VERIFY --> PIPELINE --> env --> secrets --> monitor
                                                                    ^^^^^^    ^^^^^^^^
```

Ask Q4 (see Decision Gates section).

Based on user choice:

- **Verify then CI/CD:**
  > `Skill: arn-infra:arn-infra-verify`
  > Then: `Skill: arn-infra:arn-infra-pipeline`

- **Verify only:**
  > `Skill: arn-infra:arn-infra-verify`

- **CI/CD only:**
  > `Skill: arn-infra:arn-infra-pipeline`

- **Skip both:** proceed to Step 7

---

### Step 7: Gate Q5 -- Environments (Expert/Intermediate Only)

**Beginner:** Skip to Step 8 (beginner optional extras prompt).

Show progress:
```
Infra Pipeline: discover --> containerize --> define --> deploy --> verify --> pipeline --> ENV --> secrets --> monitor
                                                                                           ^^^
```

Ask Q5 (see Decision Gates section).

If **Yes:**
> `Skill: arn-infra:arn-infra-env`

If **Skip:** proceed to Step 8.

---

### Step 8: Gate Q6 -- Secrets and Monitoring (Expert/Intermediate Only)

**Beginner:** Present the optional extras prompt (see Expertise-Adaptive Pipeline section). If the user selects specific extras, invoke the corresponding skills. Otherwise, skip to Step 9.

Show progress:
```
Infra Pipeline: discover --> containerize --> define --> deploy --> verify --> pipeline --> env --> SECRETS --> MONITOR
                                                                                                  ^^^^^^^    ^^^^^^^
```

Ask Q6 (see Decision Gates section).

Based on user choice:

- **Both:**
  > `Skill: arn-infra:arn-infra-secrets`
  > Then: `Skill: arn-infra:arn-infra-monitor`

- **Secrets only:**
  > `Skill: arn-infra:arn-infra-secrets`

- **Monitoring only:**
  > `Skill: arn-infra:arn-infra-monitor`

- **Skip both:** proceed to Step 9

---

### Step 9: Gate Q7 -- Completion Summary

Show final progress (Expert/Intermediate):
```
Infra Pipeline: discover --> containerize --> define --> deploy --> verify --> pipeline --> env --> secrets --> monitor
                    ✓              ✓            ✓          ✓          ✓          ✓         ✓         ✓          ✓
```

Show final progress (Beginner):
```
Infra Pipeline: discover --> containerize --> define --> deploy --> verify
                    ✓              ✓            ✓          ✓          ✓
```

Use `✓` for completed steps, `skipped` for skipped steps, and `·` for steps not reached.

Present a completion summary:

- **Experience level:** [level]
- **Entry mode:** [fresh / triage / assessment / migration]
- **Providers:** [provider list from config]
- **IaC tool:** [default IaC tool]
- **Environments:** [environment list]
- **Tooling audit:** `[tooling-manifest-path]` (completed / skipped)
- **Containerization:** Dockerfile(s) generated (completed / skipped)
- **IaC code:** [IaC tool] configurations generated (completed / skipped)
- **Deployment:** Deployed to [environment] (completed / dry-run / skipped)
- **Verification:** [PASS / WARN / FAIL / skipped]
- **CI/CD pipeline:** [platform] workflows generated (completed / skipped)
- **Environment management:** [environments] configured (completed / skipped)
- **Secrets management:** [provider] configured (completed / skipped)
- **Monitoring:** Observability configured (completed / skipped)

**Next steps:**
- "Run `/arn-infra-wizard` again to revisit any step (artifact detection will resume where appropriate)"
- "Run `/arn-infra-deploy` to deploy to additional environments"
- "Run `/arn-infra-migrate` to migrate between providers"
- If triage-driven and more issues remain: "Run `/arn-infra-triage` to process remaining infrastructure requests"

---

## Error Handling

- **Sub-skill fails or errors out:** Present the error to the user. Ask (using `AskUserQuestion`): "The [skill-name] step encountered an error: [error summary]. What would you like to do?" Options: retry this step / skip this step / abort the wizard. If retry, re-invoke the same skill. If skip, continue to the next gate. If abort, show what was completed and exit.
- **User says "stop" or "pause":** Show what has been completed and what remains. Inform: "Run `/arn-infra-wizard` again to resume (artifact detection will pick up where you left off)."
- **Arness Core not initialized (no Arness Code fields in `## Arness`):** Continue without Arness Core context. Cross-plugin features (linking to application specs/plans) will be unavailable. Optionally inform: "Arness Code is not configured. The wizard will operate in standalone mode. Install and configure the Arness Code plugin for cross-plugin features."
- **Arness Infra not initialized (`## Arness` missing):** Step 0 (ensure-config) handles this automatically. If ensure-config itself fails, inform the user and suggest running `/arn-infra-wizard` again.
- **Issue tracker unavailable for triage mode:** Fall back to Fresh/Resume mode. Inform: "No issue tracker configured -- cannot detect pending infrastructure requests. Starting standard pipeline instead."
- **Migration sub-skill fails:** The migrate skill has its own error handling and lifecycle tracking. If it returns an error, present it and ask: retry migration / abort wizard.
- **Define produces no IaC files:** If define completes but no IaC files are detected, warn the user and ask: retry define / skip to CI/CD setup / abort.
- **Deploy fails:** Present the error. The deploy skill has its own rollback procedures. Ask: retry deploy / skip to verify (to check partial deployment) / abort.
- **Tool installation fails at Q1.5:** Inform: "Some tools could not be installed automatically. You can install them manually later. Continuing with available tools." Proceed to next step.
- **Ambiguous artifacts detected:** List the detected artifacts and ask the user to clarify which state to resume from rather than guessing.
- **arn-infra plugin not installed:** If skill invocations fail because the plugin is missing, inform: "The arn-infra plugin must be installed. Add it to your project's plugin configuration."
- **Full Pipeline skill fails:** Present the error. Ask: "The [pipeline-stage] step encountered an error: [error summary]. What would you like to do?" Options: retry this stage / skip to the next stage / abort the pipeline. If retry, re-invoke the same skill. If skip, proceed to the next P gate (note: skipping execute-change or review-change may leave the pipeline in an incomplete state). If abort, show what was completed and exit.
- **Pipeline upgrade fails:** If the upgrade from Quick to Full Pipeline fails during change-spec creation, inform: "Could not create a change specification from existing artifacts. You can continue in Quick mode or try again." Options: continue Quick mode / retry upgrade / abort.
- **Pipeline artifacts from multiple changes detected:** If `.arness/infra-specs/` contains multiple `INFRA_CHANGE_*.md` files, list them and ask the user which change to resume. Do not guess.

## Constraints

- This skill MUST NOT duplicate sub-skill logic. It only handles sequencing and decision gates.
- All pipeline work is done by the invoked skills via the Skill tool.
- Sub-skill invocations use the Skill tool with fully qualified names: `Skill: arn-infra:arn-infra-<name>`.
- Progress display uses the compact format shown above -- one line showing the full pipeline with the current stage highlighted.
- The wizard runs in normal conversation (not plan mode).
- Beginner mode simplifies the pipeline to 6 core steps with optional advanced extras.
- Expert/Intermediate mode presents the full 10-step pipeline with all 7 decision gates.
- The wizard never deletes existing artifacts when starting fresh -- it builds alongside or replaces via the invoked skills' own logic.
- Full Pipeline mode uses P1-P6 gates. Quick mode uses Q1-Q7 gates. These gate sets are mutually exclusive within a session.
- Interactive-to-pipeline upgrade is a one-way transition. Once upgraded, the session continues in Full Pipeline mode.
- Full Pipeline mode does not apply the Expertise-Adaptive Pipeline simplification (beginner mode). All 6 stages are always presented regardless of experience level.
