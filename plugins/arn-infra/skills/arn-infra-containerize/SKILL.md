# Arness Infra Containerize

Generate production-ready Dockerfiles, docker-compose configurations, and .dockerignore files for the application. This skill produces security-audited, multi-stage container configurations adapted to the application's technology stack and topology.

This skill reads the application context (codebase patterns, architecture, technology stack) based on the project topology, invokes the `arn-infra-specialist` agent for container configuration generation, and the `arn-infra-security-auditor` agent for security review. All generated files are presented for user approval before being written.

## Prerequisites

Read `## Arness` from the project's CLAUDE.md. If no `## Arness` section exists or Arness Infra fields are missing, inform the user: "Arness Infra is not configured for this project yet. Run `arn-infra-wizard` to get started — it will set everything up automatically." Do not proceed without it.

Check the **Deferred** field. If `Deferred: yes`, inform the user: "Infrastructure is in deferred mode. Containerization is not available until infrastructure is fully configured. Run `arn-infra-assess` to un-defer." Stop.

Extract:
- **Project topology** -- how to resolve the application project (monorepo, separate-repo, infra-only)
- **Application path** -- path to the application project root
- **Experience level** -- derived from user profile. Read `~/.arness/user-profile.yaml` (or `.claude/arness-profile.local.md` if it exists — project override takes precedence). Apply the experience derivation mapping from `<arn-infra-plugin-root>/skills/arn-infra-ensure-config/references/experience-derivation.md`. If no profile exists, check for legacy `Experience level` in `## Arness` as fallback.
- **Providers** -- informs container registry selection and platform-specific optimizations
- **Tooling manifest** -- path to check for Docker/container tools availability

## Workflow

### Step 1: Resolve Application Context

Resolve the application project based on topology to understand the technology stack, services, and dependencies.

**Monorepo (`Application path: .`):**
- Read codebase patterns from the local code-patterns directory (path from `## Arness` config)
- Read `architecture.md` for technology stack, services, and dependencies
- Scan the source tree for: `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`, `go.mod`, `Cargo.toml`, `pom.xml`, `*.csproj`, `Gemfile`
- Identify application entry points, build commands, and runtime requirements

**Separate repo:**
- Navigate to `Application path`
- Read the application's `## Arness` config, code patterns, and architecture
- Scan for the same dependency/entry point files
- If the path is unreachable, inform the user and ask them to describe the application stack manually

**Infra-only:**
- No application to analyze directly
- Ask the user to describe: language/framework, services (web, API, workers), databases, build commands, runtime requirements
- Proceed with user-provided context

---

### Step 2: Check Existing Container Configurations

Scan for existing container files:
- `Dockerfile`, `Dockerfile.*`, `*.Dockerfile`
- `docker-compose.yml`, `docker-compose.yaml`, `compose.yml`, `compose.yaml`, `docker-compose.*.yml`
- `.dockerignore`

**If existing files found:**
Present findings: "I found existing container configurations: [list files]."

Ask the user:

**"What would you like to do with existing container configurations?"**

Options:
1. **Replace** -- Generate new configurations (existing files will be overwritten after your approval)
2. **Augment** -- Keep existing files and add missing configurations
3. **Review only** -- Run a security audit on the existing files without generating new ones

**If the user chooses Review only:** Skip to Step 5 (security audit) with existing files.

**If no existing files found:** Continue to Step 3.

---

### Step 3: Determine Container Strategy

Based on the application analysis from Step 1, determine what container files are needed.

**Single-service applications:**
- Generate: `Dockerfile`, `.dockerignore`
- Optionally generate `docker-compose.yml` if the app depends on external services (database, cache, queue)

**Multi-service applications:**
- Generate: one `Dockerfile` per service (or `Dockerfile.<service>`)
- Generate: `docker-compose.yml` with all services
- Generate: `.dockerignore`

Ask the user to confirm the container strategy:

"Based on your application, I plan to generate:
- [list of files to generate]
- Multi-stage builds for [production optimization / smaller images]
- [Development docker-compose with hot reload / Production-only compose]

Does this look right, or would you like to adjust?"

---

### Step 4: Invoke Specialist Agent for Generation

Load the appropriate reference files based on the detected technology stack:

> Read the local override or plugin default for `dockerfile-patterns.md`.

If multi-service or compose is needed:

> Read the local override or plugin default for `compose-patterns.md`.

Invoke the `arn-infra-specialist` agent via the Task tool, passing the model from `.arness/agent-models/infra.md` as the `model` parameter (see `plugins/arn-infra/skills/arn-infra-ensure-config/references/ensure-config.md` "Dispatch convention" for fallback). Context:

--- APPLICATION CONTEXT ---
Technology stack: [language, framework, runtime version]
Services: [list of services with roles]
Build commands: [build steps for each service]
Entry points: [start commands for each service]
Dependencies: [external services -- databases, caches, queues]
Environment variables: [required env vars, without values]
Ports: [exposed ports per service]
--- END APPLICATION CONTEXT ---

--- CONTAINER PATTERNS ---
[content from dockerfile-patterns.md, filtered to relevant language(s)]
[content from compose-patterns.md, if multi-service]
--- END CONTAINER PATTERNS ---

--- INFRASTRUCTURE CONFIG ---
Experience level: [derived from user profile]
Providers: [from ## Arness -- for registry and platform hints]
--- END INFRASTRUCTURE CONFIG ---

--- INSTRUCTIONS ---
Generate container configurations for the application.
For each Dockerfile:
- Use multi-stage builds (builder stage + production stage)
- Pin base image versions (no :latest tags)
- Run as non-root user in the production stage
- Order layers for optimal cache utilization (dependencies before source code)
- Include health check instructions
- Minimize image size (use alpine/slim/distroless where appropriate)
For docker-compose.yml (if multi-service):
- Define all services with proper dependency ordering
- Use named volumes for persistent data
- Configure networks for service isolation
- Include health checks for dependent services
- Add environment variable placeholders (never hardcode secrets)
For .dockerignore:
- Exclude version control, IDE files, test directories, documentation
- Exclude secrets files (.env, *.pem, *.key)
- Exclude build artifacts and node_modules / venv / target directories
Adapt comment verbosity to the experience level.
--- END INSTRUCTIONS ---

---

### Step 5: Security Audit

Load the security checklist:

> Read `<arn-infra-plugin-root>/skills/arn-infra-containerize/references/container-security-checklist.md` for container security requirements.

Invoke the `arn-infra-security-auditor` agent via the Task tool, passing the model from `.arness/agent-models/infra.md` as the `model` parameter (see `plugins/arn-infra/skills/arn-infra-ensure-config/references/ensure-config.md` "Dispatch convention" for fallback). Context:

--- FILES TO AUDIT ---
[generated Dockerfile content(s)]
[generated docker-compose.yml content, if any]
[generated .dockerignore content]
--- END FILES TO AUDIT ---

--- SECURITY CHECKLIST ---
[content from container-security-checklist.md]
--- END SECURITY CHECKLIST ---

--- INSTRUCTIONS ---
Review the generated container configurations against the security checklist.
Check for:
- Running as root user
- Unpinned base image versions
- Secrets in build args, environment variables, or layers
- Missing health checks
- Unnecessary packages or tools in production stage
- Exposed ports that should not be public
- Missing .dockerignore entries for sensitive files
Produce a security audit report with categorized findings.
--- END INSTRUCTIONS ---

**If critical or high findings are returned:**
Apply the security auditor's recommendations to the generated files automatically. Present the changes to the user: "The security audit found [N] issues. I have applied the following fixes: [list fixes]. Review the updated files below."

**If only medium or low findings:**
Present the findings as advisory notes alongside the generated files.

---

### Step 6: Present Generated Files for Approval

Present each generated file to the user with syntax highlighting:

"Here are the generated container configurations:

**Dockerfile** (or **Dockerfile.[service]** for each service):
```dockerfile
[generated content]
```

**docker-compose.yml** (if generated):
```yaml
[generated content]
```

**.dockerignore:**
```
[generated content]
```

**Security audit results:** [summary of findings]

Ask the user:

**"How would you like to proceed with the generated files?"**

Options:
1. **Approve and write** -- Write all files to the project
2. **Edit** -- Make changes before writing
3. **Regenerate** -- Adjust the configuration and regenerate

---

### Step 7: Write Files and Summarize

Upon user approval, write each generated file to the appropriate location:
- For monorepo: write to the project root (or to each service directory for multi-service)
- For separate-repo: write to the `Application path`
- For infra-only: write to the current project root

Present the summary:

**Containerization Summary:**
- **Files created:** [list with paths]
- **Base images used:** [list with pinned versions]
- **Security audit:** [passed / N findings addressed]
- **Multi-stage builds:** [yes / no]
- **Services containerized:** [count]

**Recommended next steps:**

"Container configurations are ready. Here is the recommended path:

1. **Test locally:** Run `docker compose up` (or `docker build .`) to verify the configurations work
2. **Define infrastructure:** Run `arn-infra-define` to generate IaC for deploying these containers
3. **Set up CI/CD:** Run `arn-infra-pipeline` to generate a CI/CD pipeline with container builds

Or run `arn-infra-wizard` for the full guided pipeline."

---

## Error Handling

- **`## Arness` config missing:** Suggest running `arn-infra-wizard` to get started. Stop.
- **Application path unreachable (separate-repo):** Ask the user to describe the application stack manually. Continue with user-provided context.
- **Specialist agent fails:** Report the error. Fall back to generating basic container configurations directly using the loaded reference patterns, without the agent. Present them with a note: "Generated using fallback patterns -- review carefully before use."
- **Specialist agent returns empty output:** Inform the user and ask for more details about the application stack. Retry with the additional context.
- **Security auditor fails:** Present the generated files without the security audit. Warn: "Security audit could not be performed. Review the generated files manually for: non-root user, pinned base images, no secrets in layers, health checks, and minimal production images before deploying."
- **Security auditor returns critical findings that cannot be auto-fixed:** Present the findings and ask the user to resolve them manually before proceeding. Do not write files with unresolved critical findings.
- **Docker not installed:** Warn: "Docker is not detected. The generated configurations are still valid but cannot be tested locally until Docker is installed." Continue generating.
- **Unsupported language/framework:** If the application uses a language not covered in the patterns reference, generate a generic Dockerfile with comments explaining where to customize. Note the limitation.
- **Re-running is safe:** Re-running overwrites existing generated files (after user approval). Existing custom configurations are not touched unless the user explicitly chooses Replace.
