# Reference Manifest

Catalog of all 28 evolving reference files in the arn-infra plugin. These files contain version-sensitive content (tool versions, MCP package names, CLI install commands, base image tags, IaC syntax) that goes stale over time and benefits from periodic refresh via online research.

The 18 static reference files (schemas, checklists, workflow definitions) are excluded -- they do not contain version-sensitive content and do not need refresh.

## Categories

| Category | File Count | Refresh Cadence | Description |
|----------|-----------|-----------------|-------------|
| registries | 4 | Quarterly | Tool and provider registries with package names, versions, install commands |
| iac-patterns | 7 | Semi-annually | Infrastructure-as-Code patterns with syntax, best practices, module references |
| container-patterns | 2 | Semi-annually | Container build and orchestration patterns with base images, build stages |
| cicd-patterns | 3 | Semi-annually | CI/CD pipeline patterns with action versions, runner images, security tools |

**Total: 28 unique evolving files across 6 categories (30 read directives across 12 skills — `gitlab-ci-patterns.md` is referenced twice in arn-infra-pipeline for both GitLab CI and Bitbucket Pipelines, and `rollback-patterns.md` is referenced in both arn-infra-deploy and arn-infra-cleanup)**

## Source Path Convention

All source paths in this manifest are relative to `<arn-infra-plugin-root>/skills/`. The full plugin path for any file is:

```
<arn-infra-plugin-root>/skills/<source-path>
```

For example, `arn-infra-discover/references/mcp-registry.md` resolves to:

```
<arn-infra-plugin-root>/skills/arn-infra-discover/references/mcp-registry.md
```

When externalized to the project-local override directory, the file is copied to:

```
.arness/infra-references/<filename>
```

The flat structure works because all 28 filenames are unique across skills.

## Refresh Strategy Notes

- **Quarterly** files contain rapidly-changing content (package versions, install commands) that should be verified against official sources every 3 months
- **Semi-annually** files contain patterns and best practices that evolve with major tool releases, typically 1-2 times per year
- **Annually** files contain foundational guides and overviews that change slowly, typically only when major new tools or providers emerge
- The refresh skill (`arn-infra-refresh`) uses these strategies to construct targeted search queries for the researcher agent
