# Pipeline Preference Schema

This reference defines the canonical YAML schema, two-tier storage model, lookup chain, and read/write protocol for all preference-gated skills. Skills that check preferences read this file for consistent behavior.

---

## YAML Schema

All preferences live under the `pipeline:` namespace. Each key accepts a fixed set of string values.

```yaml
pipeline:
  spec-review: review | proceed | upload | ask
  plan-review: review | skip | ask
  implementation-review: review | skip | ask
  sketch-preview: always | never | ask
  simplification: always | auto-all | skip | ask
  expert-debate: standard | auto | ask
  complex-phase-upgrade: always | never | ask
```

### Key Definitions

| Key | Values | Gate Behavior |
|-----|--------|---------------|
| `spec-review` | `review` = full spec review with user; `proceed` = auto-proceed to planning; `upload` = user provides own spec file; `ask` = show gate each time (no follow-up) | arn-planning G3 |
| `plan-review` | `review` = present plan for user review; `skip` = auto-approve plan; `ask` = show gate each time (no follow-up) | arn-planning G4 |
| `implementation-review` | `review` = full implementation review; `skip` = skip review (see complexity override below); `ask` = show gate each time (no follow-up) | arn-implementing G4 |
| `sketch-preview` | `always` = generate sketch preview; `never` = skip sketch preview; `ask` = show gate each time (no follow-up) | arn-code-swift 2b, arn-code-standard 2b |
| `simplification` | `always` = run simplification pass; `auto-all` = run simplification and auto-approve all non-deferred findings without prompting (used by batch-implement workers); `skip` = skip simplification; `ask` = show gate each time (no follow-up) | arn-implementing G3, arn-code-swift 4b/5b, arn-code-standard 5b, arn-code-batch-implement workers |
| `expert-debate` | `standard` = standard spec (no expert debate); `auto` = propose expert debate when scope score is 16+ (see threshold below); `ask` = show gate each time (no follow-up) | arn-planning G2 |
| `complex-phase-upgrade` | `always` = auto-upgrade executor to Opus for any phase the planner rates `complex`; `never` = never upgrade (skip the gate silently); `ask` = show the all-or-none gate each time (no follow-up). See "Complex Phase Upgrade" section below for the silence rule and within-batch auto-apply behavior. | arn-code-plan Step 5, arn-code-batch-planning per-batch-entry |

## Two-Tier Storage Model

Preferences use two personal files. Neither file is committed to version control.

### Global Personal

- **Path:** `~/.arness/workflow-preferences.yaml`
- **Purpose:** Portable across all projects. First write target.
- **Created by:** Gate skills on first encounter (not by ensure-config).

### Project Personal Override

- **Path:** `.arness/workflow.local.yaml`
- **Purpose:** Project-specific overrides. Gitignored via `.arness/*.local.yaml` pattern.
- **Created by:** User manually, or a future management skill. Never created automatically.

### Schema

Both files use the identical schema:

```yaml
pipeline:
  spec-review: review
  plan-review: skip
  implementation-review: review
  sketch-preview: always
  simplification: skip
  expert-debate: standard
```

Keys may be omitted -- only present keys are read. No checksums -- these are user-owned files.

---

## Lookup Chain

```
project override (.arness/workflow.local.yaml)
  > global (~/.arness/workflow-preferences.yaml)
  > null (first encounter)
```

For a given key:

1. Check `.arness/workflow.local.yaml` -- if the file exists and contains the key under `pipeline:`, use that value.
2. If file is missing or key is absent, check `~/.arness/workflow-preferences.yaml` -- if the file exists and contains the key under `pipeline:`, use that value.
3. If both are missing or neither contains the key, treat the value as **null** (first encounter).

---

## Read Protocol

After resolving a key's value through the lookup chain, the skill branches:

### null (First Encounter)

The user has never been asked about this preference.

1. **Show the gate** -- present the AskUserQuestion with the original options.
2. **Show the follow-up** -- after the user answers, ask the memory question (see Write Protocol below).

### ask (Returning Decliner)

The user was previously asked and chose not to store a preference.

1. **Show the gate** -- present the AskUserQuestion with the original options.
2. **Do NOT show the follow-up** -- the user already declined memory. Respect that decision.

### Valid Value (Stored Preference)

The user has a stored preference that matches one of the valid values for this key.

1. **Auto-proceed** -- apply the stored preference without asking.
2. **Show a status line** -- brief message confirming the auto-proceed action and its source.

---

## Write Protocol

### Follow-Up Question

After a gate question is answered and the preference value is **null** (first encounter), ask:

Ask (using `AskUserQuestion`):
> **Should Arness remember this choice for future sessions?**
> 1. Yes, always [action description] (saves to preferences)
> 2. No, ask me each time

- If **Yes:** Write the chosen value to `~/.arness/workflow-preferences.yaml` under the `pipeline:` namespace. Create the file and `~/.arness/` directory if they do not exist.
- If **No:** Write `ask` to `~/.arness/workflow-preferences.yaml` under the `pipeline:` namespace. This marks the user as a returning decliner -- they will still see the gate but not the follow-up.

### First Write Target

All preference writes go to **`~/.arness/workflow-preferences.yaml`** (global). This ensures the preference is portable across projects. If the user later wants a project-specific override, they create `.arness/workflow.local.yaml` manually or via a future management skill.

### File Creation

When writing to `~/.arness/workflow-preferences.yaml` for the first time:

1. Run: `mkdir -p ~/.arness`
2. Write the file with the `pipeline:` namespace and the single key being stored.

When adding a key to an existing file, read the file first, add or update the key under `pipeline:`, and write the file back. Preserve all existing keys.

---

## Invalid Value Handling

If a key's resolved value does not match any valid value for that key (e.g., a typo, an outdated value, or an unrecognized string):

- Treat the value as **null** (first encounter).
- Show the gate question and follow-up as if no preference existed.
- Do not crash, warn, or delete the invalid value from the file.

---

## Complexity Override

When `implementation-review` resolves to `skip`, the skill still recommends a review if the current implementation meets either threshold:

- **3 or more phases** in the implementation plan, OR
- **15 or more files** touched across all phases

When the override triggers:

1. Show a recommendation message: "This implementation touches [N phases / N files]. A review is recommended even though your preference is to skip."
2. Present the review gate as a one-time question (not stored as a preference change).
3. The stored `skip` preference is **not modified** -- the override is situational.

---

## Expert Debate Threshold

When `expert-debate` resolves to `auto`:

- Propose expert debate only when the scope router score is **16 or higher** (top-quartile complexity).
- Below 16, proceed with standard spec without proposing a debate.
- The threshold of 16+ replaces the previous 13+ threshold to reserve expert debate for genuinely exceptional complexity.

---

## Complex Phase Upgrade

When `complex-phase-upgrade` resolves to a non-null value, the gate at `arn-code-plan` Step 5 (and `arn-code-batch-planning` per-batch-entry) checks the planner's per-phase complexity ratings AND the active model profile before deciding whether to fire.

### Profile-aware silence

The gate is **silently skipped** when the active model profile is `all-opus` (read from CLAUDE.md `## Arness` block: `Code agent model profile:`). Rationale: every agent is already on Opus, so there is nothing to upgrade. The gate would be a no-op prompt.

The gate fires when the profile is `balanced`, `custom`, or undetectable (treat unknown as a runs-the-gate condition — the user gets the choice; if they accept, the override propagates regardless of any agent-models lookup).

### Gate granularity: all-or-none per plan

When at least one phase in the plan is rated `complex`, the gate prompt is **all-or-none**: "N phases are rated complex (rationale: ...) — upgrade ALL of them to Opus for execution? Yes / No". This gives the user one decision per plan. Per-task or per-phase Y/N would create excessive friction; users can still do per-task overrides via `/arn-code-execute-task` with manual model override.

If the user accepts, every `complex` phase in the plan gets `implementation.modelOverride: "opus"` written to PROGRESS_TRACKER.json by `arn-code-save-plan`. Phases rated `simple` or `moderate` are NOT upgraded.

### Within-batch auto-apply (arn-code-batch-planning only)

`arn-code-batch-planning` produces multiple plans in sequence. When the gate fires for the first plan with complex phases in a batch session, the user's answer is captured in **session-scoped memory** for that batch run AND optionally persisted to `~/.arness/workflow-preferences.yaml` via the standard remember-this follow-up.

- If the user answers Yes (with no remember-this) → mark current plan's complex phases for upgrade AND silently auto-apply Yes to subsequent batch entries (no nag mid-batch). Session memory only.
- If the user answers No (with no remember-this) → no upgrade for current plan AND silently skip the gate for subsequent batch entries.
- If the user persists `always` via remember-this → applies to current AND subsequent batch entries AND all future sessions.
- If the user persists `never` via remember-this → no gate fires anywhere.
- If the user persists `ask` via remember-this → the gate continues to fire per-batch-entry in subsequent batches. Within the current batch, the latest answer still controls subsequent entries (session memory).

This prevents the user from being prompted repeatedly when working through many batch entries with similar complexity profiles.

### Override scope: executor only

The override applies only to the executor agent's dispatch. Reviewer dispatches stay on the configured tier. The user explicitly framed this as an executor upgrade (the agent that does the actual code modification), and reviewers re-run targeted tests + validate against patterns — operational work where Sonnet (in `balanced`) is sufficient.

A future enhancement could add `pipeline.complex-phase-reviewer-upgrade` if data shows reviewer-tier upgrades on complex phases produce meaningfully better outcomes.

### Cost tradeoff

If you find yourself frequently answering Yes to the upgrade gate, consider switching to the `all-opus` profile instead. The `balanced` profile + `complex-phase-upgrade: always` may end up paying Opus cost for most phases anyway, defeating the cost saving. The `complex-phase-upgrade` feature is most useful when you genuinely want `balanced` defaults but are willing to upgrade for known-complex work.

## Status Line Format

When auto-proceeding with a stored preference, display a brief status line. The format depends on the source file:

**From global file:**
```
Preference: [action description] (stored in workflow-preferences.yaml)
```

**From project override:**
```
Preference: [action description] (project override in workflow.local.yaml)
```

### Examples

```
Preference: proceeding to plan without spec review (stored in workflow-preferences.yaml)
Preference: skipping implementation review (project override in workflow.local.yaml)
Preference: generating sketch preview (stored in workflow-preferences.yaml)
Preference: running simplification pass (stored in workflow-preferences.yaml)
Preference: standard spec, no expert debate (stored in workflow-preferences.yaml)
Preference: expert debate proposed (scope score 18, auto mode in workflow-preferences.yaml)
Preference: upgrading 3 complex phases to Opus executor (stored in workflow-preferences.yaml)
Preference: complex phase upgrade silenced — profile is all-opus (no upgrade needed)
Preference: complex phase upgrade applied to remaining batch entries (session auto-apply)
```
