# Arness Implementing

Execute an implementation plan, run a quick implementation (swift), run a standard-tier implementation, or manage the build-simplify-review cycle. This is a first-citizen entry point that orchestrates `arn-code-execute-plan`, `arn-code-swift`, `arn-code-standard`, `arn-code-simplify`, `arn-code-review-implementation`, and related execution skills. Chains from `arn-planning` and chains to `arn-shipping` or `arn-assessing` at completion.

This skill is a **sequencer and decision-gate handler**. It MUST NOT duplicate sub-skill logic. All implementation work is done by the invoked skills. Arness-implementing handles: input routing, state detection, execution mode selection, the simplify/review cycle, and chaining.

## Step 0: Ensure Configuration

Read `<arn-code-plugin-root>/skills/arn-code-ensure-config/references/step-0-fast-path.md` and follow its instructions. This guarantees a user profile exists and `## Arness` is configured with Arness Code fields before proceeding.

After Step 0 completes, extract the following from `## Arness`:
- **Plans directory** — for detecting structured plans and project folders
- **Code patterns** — path to stored pattern documentation
- **Template path** — path to report templates

## Workflow

### Step 0: Input Routing

Check the trigger message for swift or standard intent:

- **"swift: [description]"**, **"quick: [description]"**, **"quick change: [description]"**, or **"quick implementation: [description]"** detected:
  → Route directly to the Swift Path (Step S1). Skip all state detection.

- **"standard: [description]"** or **"standard mode: [description]"** detected:
  → Route directly to the Standard Path (Step ST1). Skip all state detection.

- **No swift or standard intent** detected:
  → Proceed to Step 1 (State Detection).

---

### Step 1: State Detection

Check which artifacts exist on disk to determine the entry point. Check from most advanced to least advanced — first match wins:

| Artifact | Detected State | Resume Point |
|----------|---------------|--------------|
| `SIMPLIFICATION_REPORT.json` in `<plans-dir>/<project>/reports/` | Simplification done | G4 (Review implementation) |
| Any `IMPLEMENTATION_REPORT_*.json` or `TESTING_REPORT_*.json` in `<plans-dir>/<project>/reports/` (no SIMPLIFICATION_REPORT) | Execution complete | G3 (Simplify?) |
| `TASKS.md` in `<plans-dir>/<project>/` with parseable task entries | Tasks exist | G2 (Execution mode) |
| `INTRODUCTION.md` in `<plans-dir>/<project>/` but no `TASKS.md` | Plan saved, not taskified | Auto-taskify, then G2 |
| `SWIFT_REPORT.json` in `<plans-dir>/SWIFT_<name>/` | Swift complete | G5 (Completion handoff) |
| `<plans-dir>/SWIFT_<name>/SWIFT_<name>.md` but no report | Swift plan exists, not executed | Resume swift execution |
| `STANDARD_REPORT.json` in `<plans-dir>/STANDARD_<name>/` | Standard complete | G5 (Completion handoff) |
| `<plans-dir>/STANDARD_<name>/STANDARD_<name>.md` but no report | Standard in progress | Resume standard execution |
| None of the above | No plan found | G0 (No plan fallback) |

**If multiple projects detected** (more than one subdirectory in plans-dir with artifacts): list them with their states and ask the user which to implement.

**If artifacts detected for a single project:** ask: "Resume [project-name] at [detected stage], or start fresh?"
- **Resume** → skip to the detected gate
- **Start fresh** → begin at G0/G2 (do not delete existing artifacts)

---

### Step 2: Gate G0 — No Plan Fallback

Only reached when no structured plan or swift artifacts are found.

Show progress:
```
Implementing: [no plan detected]
```

Ask the user:

**"No implementation plan found. What would you like to do?"**

Options:
1. **Quick implementation** — Describe a small change for swift mode
2. **Go to planning first** — Run `arn-planning` to create a spec and plan

If **Quick implementation**: Ask for a description, then route to Swift Path (Step S1).
If **Go to planning first**: Codex skill `arn-planning`. After planning completes and chains back, re-run state detection (Step 1). If the scope router assigned `standard` tier, route to Standard Path (Step ST1) instead of full execution.

---

### Step 3: Auto — Taskify (conditional)

If state detection found `INTRODUCTION.md` but no `TASKS.md`, run taskify automatically:

Inform: "Creating task list from plan..."

> Codex skill `arn-code-taskify`

After taskify completes, proceed to G2.

---

### Step 4: Gate G2 — Execution Mode

Show progress:
```
Implementing: EXECUTE -> simplify -> review-impl -> [ship]
              ^^^^^^^
```

Ask the user:

**"How should the tasks be executed?"**

Options:
1. **Sequential with review gates** (Recommended) — Each task is executed and reviewed before the next
2. **Parallel with Agent Teams** — Tasks run in parallel using Agent Teams (higher token cost)
3. **One task at a time** — Execute tasks manually, one at a time

Based on choice:
- **Sequential** → Codex skill `arn-code-execute-plan`
- **Agent Teams** → Codex skill `arn-code-execute-plan-teams`
  - If Agent Teams is not available (environment variable not set), inform the user and suggest sequential instead.
- **One at a time** → Codex skill `arn-code-execute-task`
  - After each task, the user controls which task to run next. When the user is done or all tasks are complete, proceed to G3.

---

### Step 5: Gate G3 — Simplify?

Show progress:
```
Implementing: execute -> SIMPLIFY -> review-impl -> [ship]
                         ^^^^^^^^
```

**Preference check:** Read `pipeline.simplification` using the two-tier lookup chain (see `<arn-code-plugin-root>/skills/arn-code-ensure-config/references/preferences-schema.md`):

1. Read `.arness/workflow.local.yaml` — if the file exists and `pipeline.simplification` is present, use that value and note source.
2. If not found, read `~/.arness/workflow-preferences.yaml` — if the file exists and `pipeline.simplification` is present, use that value and note source.
3. If neither found or key is absent, treat as null (first encounter).

Branch on the resolved value:

- If `always`: Show status line: "Preference: running simplification pass ([source])". Auto-proceed to Codex skill `arn-code-simplify`. After simplification completes, proceed to G4.

- If `skip`: Show status line: "Preference: skipping simplification ([source])". Auto-proceed to G4.

- If `ask`: Present the gate below. Do NOT show the "remember this?" follow-up afterward.

- If null (or invalid value): Present the gate below. After the user answers, show the "remember this?" follow-up (see below).

**Gate (shown when value is `ask`, null, or invalid):**

Ask the user:

**"Execution complete. Simplify the implementation before review?"**

Options:
1. **Yes** (Recommended for 3+ phases) — Review for reuse opportunities, quality issues, and efficiency improvements
2. **Skip** — Proceed without simplification

If **Yes**: Codex skill `arn-code-simplify`
If **Skip**: Proceed to G4.

**Follow-up (only when preference was null):** After the user answers the gate, ask:

Ask the user:

**"Should Arness remember this choice for future sessions?"**

Options:
1. **Yes, always [chosen action]** (saves to preferences)
2. **No, ask me each time**

If **Yes**: Write the chosen value (`always` or `skip`) to `~/.arness/workflow-preferences.yaml` under `pipeline.simplification`. Create `~/.arness/` directory and file if they do not exist. If the file already exists, read it first, add or update the key under `pipeline:`, and write back preserving all existing keys.
If **No**: Write `ask` to `~/.arness/workflow-preferences.yaml` under `pipeline.simplification` (same write logic).

---

### Step 6: Gate G4 — Review Implementation?

Show progress:
```
Implementing: execute -> simplify -> REVIEW-IMPL -> [ship]
                                     ^^^^^^^^^^^
```

**Preference check:** Read `pipeline.implementation-review` using the two-tier lookup chain (see `<arn-code-plugin-root>/skills/arn-code-ensure-config/references/preferences-schema.md`):

1. Read `.arness/workflow.local.yaml` — if the file exists and `pipeline.implementation-review` is present, use that value and note source.
2. If not found, read `~/.arness/workflow-preferences.yaml` — if the file exists and `pipeline.implementation-review` is present, use that value and note source.
3. If neither found or key is absent, treat as null (first encounter).

Branch on the resolved value:

- If `review`: Show status line: "Preference: reviewing implementation ([source])". Auto-proceed to Codex skill `arn-code-review-implementation`. If the review verdict is **NEEDS FIXES**: the review skill handles fixes internally. After fixes, re-present this gate (the user may want to review again or proceed). After review completes successfully, proceed to G5.

- If `skip`: **Complexity override check** — count the number of phases from the plan structure (phase plan files in `<plans-dir>/<project>/plans/`) and count files modified/created across all implementation and testing reports in `<plans-dir>/<project>/reports/`. If implementation reports cannot be parsed or are missing, default to showing the review recommendation (err on the side of review). If **3 or more phases** OR **15 or more files** touched: override the skip preference and present a recommendation:

  "This implementation touches [N phases / N files]. A review is recommended even though your preference is to skip."

  Then present the gate below as a one-time question (the stored `skip` preference is NOT modified — this override is situational).

  If under both thresholds: Show status line: "Preference: skipping implementation review ([source])". Auto-proceed to G5.

- If `ask`: Present the gate below. Do NOT show the "remember this?" follow-up afterward.

- If null (or invalid value): Present the gate below. After the user answers, show the "remember this?" follow-up (see below).

**Gate (shown when value is `ask`, null, invalid, or `skip` with complexity override):**

Ask the user:

**"Review the implementation against plan and patterns?"**

Options:
1. **Yes** (Recommended for 3+ phases) — Full implementation review
2. **Skip** — Proceed without review

If **Yes**: Codex skill `arn-code-review-implementation`

If the review verdict is **NEEDS FIXES**: the review skill handles fixes internally. After fixes, re-present this gate (the user may want to review again or proceed).

If **Skip**: Proceed to G5.

**Follow-up (only when preference was null — not shown for complexity override):** After the user answers the gate, ask:

Ask the user:

**"Should Arness remember this choice for future sessions?"**

Options:
1. **Yes, always [chosen action]** (saves to preferences)
2. **No, ask me each time**

If **Yes**: Write the chosen value (`review` or `skip`) to `~/.arness/workflow-preferences.yaml` under `pipeline.implementation-review`. Create `~/.arness/` directory and file if they do not exist. If the file already exists, read it first, add or update the key under `pipeline:`, and write back preserving all existing keys.
If **No**: Write `ask` to `~/.arness/workflow-preferences.yaml` under `pipeline.implementation-review` (same write logic).

---

### Step 7: Gate G5 — Completion Handoff

**Generate CHANGE_RECORD.json for thorough tier (conditional):**

Before presenting the completion handoff, check if this is a thorough-tier project that needs a CHANGE_RECORD.json. A project is thorough-tier when it has a full project structure (`INTRODUCTION.md`, phase plans, reports) and its artifact directory does NOT use the `SWIFT_` or `STANDARD_` prefix.

If thorough-tier detected AND no `CHANGE_RECORD.json` exists in `<plans-dir>/<project>/`:
1. Read `CHANGE_RECORD_TEMPLATE.json` from the template path configured in `## Arness`
2. Populate with:
   - `recordType`: `"change-record"`
   - `version`: `1`
   - `ceremonyTier`: `"thorough"`
   - `projectName`: the project name
   - `changePath`: `<plans-dir>/<project>/`
   - `timestamp`: current ISO 8601 timestamp
   - `tierSelection`: `{ "recommended": "thorough", "selected": "thorough", "overrideReason": null }` (or from the scope router's original recommendation if available in INTRODUCTION.md metadata)
   - `specRef`: path to the source spec (from `INTRODUCTION.md` metadata if available)
   - `planRef`: path to `INTRODUCTION.md`
   - `reportRef`: path to the most recent `IMPLEMENTATION_REPORT_*.json` in `<plans-dir>/<project>/reports/`
   - `filesModified` / `filesCreated`: aggregated from all implementation reports in the project
   - `commitHash`: `""` (populated by arn-code-ship after commit)
   - `commitMessage`: `""` (populated by arn-code-ship after commit)
   - `review`: verdict and finding counts from the most recent review report (if available)
   - `sketchRef`: path to sketch manifest if sketch was used, `""` otherwise
   - `nextSteps`: `[]` (populated by arn-code-ship after PR creation)
3. Write to `<plans-dir>/<project>/CHANGE_RECORD.json`

If `CHANGE_RECORD.json` already exists, skip generation.

Show progress:
```
Implementing: execute -> simplify -> review-impl -> [COMPLETE]
                                                     ^^^^^^^^
```

Ask the user:

**"Implementation complete. What next?"**

Options:
1. **Ship it** — Commit, push, and create a PR
2. **Assess quality first** — Run a codebase assessment before shipping
3. **Not yet** — Exit (run `arn-shipping` or `arn-assessing` when ready)

If **Ship it**: Codex skill `arn-shipping`
If **Assess quality first**: Codex skill `arn-assessing`
If **Not yet**: Exit.

## Swift Path

### Step S1: Invoke Swift

Show progress:
```
Implementing: SWIFT (assess -> plan -> execute -> verify) -> [ship]
              ^^^^^
```

Invoke the swift skill with the user's description:

> Codex skill `arn-code-swift` [description]

The swift skill handles everything internally: scope assessment, complexity routing (simple/moderate/complex redirect), planning, execution, testing, and review.

**If swift redirects to full pipeline** (complexity too high): the swift skill will inform the user. After swift exits, suggest running `arn-planning` for the full pipeline.

Wait for swift to complete.

---

### Step S2: Swift Completion Handoff

After swift completes, skip directly to G5 (Completion Handoff). Simplify and review-implementation are not needed — swift has its own lightweight review built in.

---

## Standard Path

### Step ST1: Invoke Standard

Show progress:
```
Implementing: STANDARD (spec-lite -> plan -> execute -> review) -> [ship]
              ^^^^^^^^
```

Invoke the standard skill with the user's description:

> Codex skill `arn-code-standard` [description]

The standard skill handles everything internally: spec-lite generation, plan creation, execution, testing, and review -- all in a single session.

**If standard redirects to full pipeline** (scope too large): the standard skill will inform the user. After standard exits, suggest running `arn-planning` for the full pipeline.

Wait for standard to complete.

---

### Step ST2: Standard Completion Handoff

After standard completes, skip directly to G5 (Completion Handoff). Simplify and review-implementation are not needed — standard has its own review built in.

---

## Sketch During Building

If during execution the user asks to preview a UI component ("show me what this looks like", "sketch this", "preview the UI"), and `ui-patterns.md` in the code patterns directory has a `## Sketch Strategy` section:

> Codex skill `arn-code-sketch`

This is an ad-hoc interrupt, not a decision gate. After the sketch session completes, resume execution where it left off.

If `ui-patterns.md` does not exist or has no Sketch Strategy: inform the user that sketch is not available. Pattern documentation will be generated on first use and will include a Sketch Strategy if your project has a UI framework.

---

## Error Handling

- **`## Arness` config missing:** Handled by Step 0 (ensure-config) — this should not occur if Step 0 completed successfully.
- **No plan found and no swift intent:** Present G0 with options.
- **Agent Teams unavailable at G2:** Inform the user that the environment variable `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS` is not set. Suggest sequential execution instead.
- **Swift redirect to full pipeline:** Inform the user. Suggest `arn-planning`.
- **Standard redirect to full pipeline:** Inform the user. Suggest `arn-planning`.
- **Multiple projects detected:** List projects with states, ask which to implement.
- **Sub-skill fails:** Present the error. Ask: retry / skip / abort.
- **User says "stop" or "pause":** Show what was completed. Inform: "Run `arn-implementing` again to resume — artifact detection will pick up where you left off."
