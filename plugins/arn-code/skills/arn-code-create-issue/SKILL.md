# Arness Create Issue

Create an issue in the configured issue tracker (GitHub or Jira) with Arness labels for type and priority.

---

## Step 1: Check Prerequisites

If no `## Arness` section exists in the project's CLAUDE.md, inform the user: "Arness is not configured for this project yet. Run `arn-planning` to get started — it will set everything up automatically." Do not proceed without it.

Read the **Issue tracker** field from `## Arness` config in the project's `CLAUDE.md` (values: `github`, `jira`, or `none`). If the `Issue tracker` field is not present, fall back to legacy detection: check for `GitHub: yes` and treat as `github`; otherwise treat as `none`.

### If Issue tracker is github

1. `git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree` — must be inside a git repository
2. `git remote -v` — must have a GitHub remote (origin pointing to github.com)
3. `gh auth status` — the GitHub CLI must be authenticated

If **any** check fails, inform the user what is missing and suggest running `arn-planning` to get started. Do not proceed until all prerequisites are satisfied.

### If Issue tracker is jira

1. Read **Jira project** and **Jira site** from `## Arness` config
2. Verify the Atlassian MCP server is available (attempt a lightweight MCP call, e.g., list projects)
3. If the MCP server is not available: "The Atlassian MCP server is not available. Run `/mcp` to check status, or run `arn-planning` to reconfigure."

### If Issue tracker is none

Inform the user: "Issue management is not configured for this project. Run `arn-planning` to get started, or configure the issue tracker manually."

STOP — do not proceed.

---

**Trigger message inference:** If the user's trigger message contains enough context to infer the issue type, priority, and title (e.g., "create issue: high priority bug — checkout page crashes on empty cart"), extract these values and present them for confirmation rather than re-asking each question separately. If the trigger message is ambiguous, proceed with the standard question flow below.

## Step 2: Classify Issue Type

Ask the user to select the issue type using `user prompt`. Present these options:

| Option | GitHub Label | Jira Issue Type | Jira Label | Description |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|------------|-------------|
| Feature request | `arness-feature-issue` | Story | `arness-feature-issue` | A new feature or enhancement |
| Bug report | `arness-bug-issue` | Bug | `arness-bug-issue` | Something is broken or not working as expected |
| Backlog item | `arness-backlog` | Task | `arness-backlog` | Deferred or low-urgency item for future consideration |

The user-facing question is the same regardless of issue tracker. The internal mapping differs by platform and is applied during submission (Step 5).

---

## Step 3: Set Priority

Ask the user to select the priority using `user prompt`. Present these options:

| Option | GitHub Label | Jira Priority | Description |
|--------|-------------|---------------|-------------|
| High | `arness-priority-high` | High | Urgent — should be addressed soon |
| Medium | `arness-priority-medium` | Medium | Important but not urgent |
| Low (default) | `arness-priority-low` | Low | Nice to have, address when convenient |

If the user does not express a preference, default to **Low**.

The user-facing question is the same regardless of issue tracker. The internal mapping differs by platform and is applied during submission (Step 5).

---

## Step 4: Compose Issue

1. Ask the user for the **issue title** (short, descriptive).
2. Ask the user for the **issue description**, or offer to compose one on their behalf.
3. If Arness context is available in the current session (spec, plan, or branch name), offer to pre-populate the description with relevant references:
   - Link to the current spec file if one exists
   - Reference the current plan/project if one is active
   - Include the branch name for traceability

### If Issue tracker is github

4. **Deferred Label Check:**

   Check if Arness labels exist by running `gh label list --search "arness-"`. If fewer than 7 Arness labels are found, create the missing ones using `gh label create --force` for each label per `<arn-code-plugin-root>/skills/arn-code-init/references/platform-labels.md`. This is idempotent and safe to run on every invocation.

### If Issue tracker is jira

4. No label pre-creation needed — Jira labels are freeform and created implicitly when applied to an issue.

---

## Step 5: Submit

### If Issue tracker is github

Create the issue using the GitHub CLI:

```bash
gh issue create --title "<title>" --body "<body>" --label "<type-label>,<priority-label>"
```

Report to the user:

- The issue number and URL (returned by `gh issue create`)
- The labels that were applied
- Suggest: "Run `arn-code-pick-issue` later to pick this up for implementation, or continue with your current work."

### If Issue tracker is jira

Use the Atlassian MCP server to create a Jira issue:

- **Project:** `<Jira project from ## Arness config>`
- **Issue type:** Story | Bug | Task (from Step 2 mapping)
- **Summary:** `<title>`
- **Description:** `<body>` (in Jira-compatible markdown)
- **Priority:** High | Medium | Low (from Step 3 mapping)
- **Labels:** `[arness-<type-label>, arness-priority-<level>]`

Report to the user:

- The issue key (e.g., PROJ-42) and URL: `https://<jira-site>/browse/<issue-key>`
- The issue type and priority that were set
- Suggest: "Run `arn-code-pick-issue` later to pick this up for implementation, or continue with your current work."

## Error Handling

- **Issue tracker is `none`** — Inform the user that issue management is not configured. Suggest running `arn-planning` to get started.
- **GitHub not available** — Inform the user and suggest running `arn-planning` to get started.
- **`gh` CLI not authenticated** — Suggest running `gh auth login` to authenticate.
- **Atlassian MCP server not available** — Inform the user. Suggest running `/mcp` to check status or `arn-planning` to reconfigure.
- **Jira project not found** — Verify the Jira project key in `## Arness` config is correct. Suggest running `arn-planning` to reconfigure.
- **Label creation fails (GitHub)** — Warn the user but proceed with issue creation. Label creation may require repository admin permissions.
- **Issue creation fails** — Show the full error message and offer to retry.
- **No GitHub remote** — Inform the user that GitHub issues require a GitHub-hosted repository.

## Conventions

- Use `<arn-code-plugin-root>` for all paths referencing plugin files.
- Reference other Arness skills with the `arn-code:skill-name` prefix (e.g., `arn-code-init`, `arn-code-pick-issue`).
