# Arness Review Plan

Validate and review a structured project plan for completeness, correctness, and pattern compliance before execution. Reports issues with severity classification and actionable fix suggestions, offers interactive remediation, and optionally proceeds to task creation.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Load the Project

Read the project's CLAUDE.md and look for a `## Arness` section. Extract:
- **Plans directory** — base path where project plans are saved
- **Code patterns** — path to the directory containing stored pattern documentation
- **Template path** — path to the report template set (JSON templates)

**If `## Arness` is not found:** inform the user: "Arness is not configured for this project yet. Run `arn-planning` to get started — it will set everything up automatically." Do not proceed.

Ask the user for `PROJECT_NAME` if not provided in the conversation.

Read all project files from `<plans-dir>/<PROJECT_NAME>/`:

```
<plans-dir>/<PROJECT_NAME>/
├── SOURCE_PLAN.md
├── INTRODUCTION.md
├── TASKS.md
├── PROGRESS_TRACKER.json
└── plans/PHASE_*.md
```

If any critical files are missing (`SOURCE_PLAN.md`, `INTRODUCTION.md`, `TASKS.md`, or any `PHASE_*.md`), report the missing files immediately. Do not attempt to run checks against missing files — instead, note the missing file as an ERROR finding and continue checking the files that do exist.

---

### Step 2: Run Structural and Document Checks

Read `<arn-code-plugin-root>/skills/arn-code-review-plan/references/validation-checks.md` and execute all generic checks (sections 1-4, 6-8) against the project files.

Classify each finding by severity:
- **ERROR** — Must fix before execution (missing files, broken dependencies, placeholder content)
- **WARNING** — Likely problems that should be addressed (missing patterns, incomplete coverage)
- **INFO** — Suggestions for improvement (optional enhancements)

For each finding, record:
- **Check ID** — the identifier from validation-checks.md (e.g., S001, I010, T015)
- **Severity** — ERROR, WARNING, or INFO
- **Description** — what the check found
- **File** — which project file the finding applies to
- **Location** — line number or section name within the file
- **Suggestion** — an actionable fix description

Suggested fixes must be specific and actionable. Examples:
- "Add 'Scope & Boundaries' section to INTRODUCTION.md after the Dependencies section"
- "Fix dependency: Task 4 references non-existent Task 9 — update to a valid task number"
- "Add report save path directive to Phase 2 Implementation section: `reports/IMPLEMENTATION_REPORT_PHASE_2.json`"

---

### Step 3: Verify Against Codebase

Validate that references in the plan actually exist in the codebase:

1. **Codebase References table** — Check that file paths listed in the INTRODUCTION.md "Codebase References" table actually exist on disk (use Glob for each path)
2. **Pattern code examples** — Spot-check 2-3 code pattern examples from INTRODUCTION.md: read the referenced file and confirm the code snippet is real and matches
3. **Test fixtures and helpers** — Verify test fixtures/helpers mentioned in INTRODUCTION.md testing patterns actually exist (use Grep to search for fixture/helper names in test files)

Add findings for any broken references. Suggestions should be specific:
- "Update path `src/old/module.py` to `src/new/module.py` in Codebase References table"
- "Remove stale reference to `conftest.py:db_session` — fixture no longer exists"
- "Code example for 'Service Layer' pattern does not match `src/services/base.py:15-30` — update snippet"

---

### Step 4: Check Pattern Compliance (Dynamic)

Read stored pattern docs from the Code patterns path in the `## Arness` config:
- `<code-patterns-dir>/code-patterns.md`
- `<code-patterns-dir>/testing-patterns.md`
- `<code-patterns-dir>/ui-patterns.md` (if it exists)

**Code pattern compliance:**
For each pattern documented in `code-patterns.md`:
- Check that phase plans reference or follow this pattern where relevant
- Flag if a phase plan contradicts a documented pattern (e.g., uses a different framework or approach than what's documented)
- Flag if a phase plan introduces patterns not found in the documentation

**Testing pattern compliance:**
For each testing pattern in `testing-patterns.md`:
- Verify test cases in phase plans use the documented test framework
- Check that test markers/tags match those defined in the testing patterns
- Check that test cases reference fixtures documented in the testing patterns
- Flag if test cases use markers or fixtures not found in the testing patterns

**UI pattern compliance (if `ui-patterns.md` exists):**
For each pattern documented in `ui-patterns.md`:
- Check that frontend tasks reference or follow UI patterns where relevant
- Flag if a phase plan uses a different component library or styling approach than what's documented
- Flag missing accessibility requirements when `ui-patterns.md` documents them

All pattern compliance findings are **WARNING** severity (not ERROR), since pattern compliance is advisory — the patterns may have been intentionally overridden for a specific phase.

Each finding includes a suggestion, e.g.:
- "Phase 2 test cases should use `@pytest.mark.unit` marker per testing patterns"
- "Phase 1 uses Flask-style routing but code-patterns.md documents FastAPI router pattern"
- "Phase 3 uses inline styles but ui-patterns.md documents Tailwind CSS approach"

### Step 5: Report

Present a human-readable summary to the user:

```
## Plan Review: <PROJECT_NAME>

### Summary
- Phases: N | Implementation tasks: N | Testing tasks: N
- Issues: N errors, N warnings, N info

### ERRORS (must fix)
1. [S001] INTRODUCTION.md missing — <project-dir>/
   → Fix: Re-run arn-code-save-plan to regenerate INTRODUCTION.md
2. [T013] Task 5 depends on "Task 9" but only 6 tasks exist — TASKS.md:45
   → Fix: Update dependency to correct task number
...

### WARNINGS (should fix)
1. [I012] Pattern "Service Layer" missing "How to apply" — INTRODUCTION.md:45
   → Fix: Add "How to apply" section with concrete instructions
...

### INFO (optional)
1. [Q004] Phase 3 has 9 implementation tasks — consider splitting
...
```

Every ERROR and WARNING includes a `→ Fix:` suggestion line.

If no issues are found, report: "Plan passed all checks — no issues found."

---

### Step 6: Remediate

Present the user with options based on what was found:

**If ERRORS exist:**

Ask the user (using user prompt):

1. **"Fix all errors automatically"** — attempt to fix every error using the suggested fixes. Edit the relevant plan files (INTRODUCTION.md, TASKS.md, PHASE_N_PLAN.md, PROGRESS_TRACKER.json).
2. **"Let me choose which to fix"** — show each error one at a time. For each, ask the user: fix or skip?
3. **"I'll fix them manually"** — exit with the report. Do not modify any files.

**If only WARNINGS exist (no errors):**

Ask the user (using user prompt):

1. **"Fix all warnings"** — attempt to fix every warning
2. **"Let me choose which to fix"** — show each warning one at a time, ask fix/skip
3. **"Skip — proceed as is"** — accept the plan with warnings

**If no issues:** skip this step entirely.

**For each fix applied:**
- Edit the relevant plan file in place
- Log the change: which file was modified, what was changed, which check ID it resolves

**After remediation:**
- Re-run only the checks that had findings to verify the fixes resolved them
- If any fixes failed or introduced new issues, report them to the user
- Update the findings with remediation status (`remediated: true` and the action taken)

---

### Step 7: Finalize and Next Steps

Generate a JSON report using the `REVIEW_REPORT_TEMPLATE.json` from the configured template path. Populate all sections:

- **summary** — total checks, error/warning/info counts, phases and tasks reviewed
- **Category sections** (structuralChecks, documentQuality, taskConsistency, patternCompliance, codebaseVerification, contentQuality) — status and category-specific findings
- **findings** — complete list of all findings with check IDs, severity, descriptions, files, locations, suggestions, and remediation status
- **remediation** — whether remediation was performed, counts, and action log
- **recommendation** — `ready` (0 errors), `fix_errors` (errors remain), or `needs_review` (warnings remain)
- **nextStep** — `arn-code-taskify` if ready, or `fix errors first`

Save the report to: `<plans-dir>/<PROJECT_NAME>/reports/REVIEW_REPORT.json`

Present the final status to the user:

- **If clean** (0 errors, 0 warnings or all fixed): "Plan is ready for execution."
- **If warnings remain**: "Plan has N remaining warnings but no blocking errors."
- **If errors remain**: "Plan still has N errors — fix before proceeding."

Offer the next step:
- "Would you like to proceed to `arn-code-taskify` to create the Claude Code task list?"
- If yes — run `arn-code-taskify` with the same `PROJECT_NAME`

## Error Handling

- If `## Arness` config is missing, do not proceed — suggest running `arn-planning` to get started.
- If the project directory does not exist, report the error and suggest running `arn-code-save-plan` first.
- If pattern documentation files are missing (for Step 4), skip pattern compliance checks and add an INFO finding: "Pattern docs not found — skipping pattern compliance. Run `arn-planning` to generate pattern docs on first use."
- If the report cannot be written (permissions), print the JSON report to the conversation so the user can save it manually.
