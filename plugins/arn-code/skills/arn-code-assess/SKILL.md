# Arness Assess

Run a comprehensive technical assessment of the codebase against stored patterns, let the user prioritize findings, then orchestrate the full Arness pipeline (spec → plan → execute → test → ship) for multiple improvements in a single session.

This skill is a **sequencer and decision-gate handler**, like arn-planning. It MUST NOT duplicate sub-skill or agent logic. All pipeline work is done by the invoked skills and agents. This skill handles: scope selection, assessment orchestration, finding prioritization, multi-spec pipeline management, and progress display.

## Prerequisites

Check for a `## Arness` section in the project's CLAUDE.md. If missing, inform the user: "Arness is not configured for this project yet. Run `arn-assessing` to get started — it will set everything up automatically." Do not proceed without it.

Additionally, verify that pattern files exist at the configured code-patterns path. At minimum, these must exist:
- `code-patterns.md`
- `testing-patterns.md`
- `architecture.md`

If any required pattern file is missing, inform the user: "Pattern documentation is incomplete. Run `arn-assessing` which will generate pattern docs on first use."

## Decision Gates

The skill pauses at exactly 7 gates. Steps marked (auto) flow without stopping.

| Gate | When | Question | Options |
|------|------|----------|---------|
| G1 | Entry | "What would you like to assess?" | Entire codebase / Specific area |
| G2 | After assessment | "Ready to prioritize?" | Prioritize / Investigate further |
| G3 | After prioritization | "How should improvements be organized?" | Bundle all / Separate specs / Arness suggests groupings |
| G4 | After all plans generated | "Plans ready. Proceed?" | Approve all / Revise specific plan / Remove a spec |
| G5 | Before each subsequent spec execution | "Conflict detected" (conditional) | Re-plan / Proceed / Skip |
| G6 | After test results | "Tests [pass/fail]. Proceed?" | Ship / Fix and re-test / Abort |
| G7 | Final | "Ship it?" | Commit, push & PR / Just commit / Not yet |

## Pipeline Overview

```
Arness Assess: scope → assess → prioritize → spec(s) → plan all → save all → [taskify+execute]×N → test → ship
```

## Workflow

### Step 0: Initialize

1. Read the project's CLAUDE.md and extract the `## Arness` section.
2. Extract configuration fields:
   - **Plans directory** — where plans and project folders live
   - **Specs directory** — where specs and assessment reports are stored
   - **Code patterns** — path to pattern documentation directory
   - **Docs directory** — for documentation generation
   - **Git** — whether git is configured
   - **GitHub/Platform** — for shipping
3. Load pattern files from the configured code-patterns path:
   - `code-patterns.md` (required)
   - `testing-patterns.md` (required)
   - `architecture.md` (required)
   - `ui-patterns.md` (optional — sets `has_ui_patterns = true`)
   - `security-patterns.md` (optional — sets `has_security_patterns = true`)

### Step 1: Detect Assessment State (Resumability)

Check for existing assessment artifacts:

| Artifact | Detected State |
|----------|---------------|
| `ASSESSMENT_*.md` in specs-dir + executed plans with reports | Near-complete — resume at test gate |
| `ASSESSMENT_*.md` in specs-dir + project folders with TASKS.md | Mid-execution — resume at taskify+execute |
| `ASSESSMENT_*.md` in specs-dir + PLAN_PREVIEW files | Plans ready — resume at G4 |
| `ASSESSMENT_*.md` in specs-dir + FEATURE specs matching assessment IDs | Specs written — resume at plan all |
| `ASSESSMENT_*.md` in specs-dir only | Assessment done — resume at G2 (prioritize) |
| None | Fresh start — begin at G1 |

If artifacts detected, ask: "It looks like you have an in-progress assessment. Resume from [stage], or start fresh?"

---

### Step 2: Gate G1 — Scope Selection

Show progress:
```
Arness Assess: SCOPE → assess → prioritize → spec(s) → plan → save → execute → test → ship             ^^^^^
```

Even if the user triggered the skill with arguments (e.g., "assess the auth module"), confirm scope with `user prompt`:

**"What would you like to assess?"**

Options:
1. **Assess entire codebase** — Full review against all stored patterns
2. **Assess specific area** — Review a particular module, directory, or concern

If **specific area**: ask the user to describe the area (module name, directory path, or concern like "authentication" or "API layer").

Store the scope for agent invocations. Derive a scope name for the assessment file:
- Entire codebase → `full-codebase`
- Specific area → kebab-case of the area (e.g., `auth-module`, `api-layer`)

---

### Step 3: Assessment

Show progress:
```
Arness Assess: scope → ASSESS → prioritize → spec(s) → plan → save → execute → test → ship                      ^^^^^^
```

Inform: "Running assessment agents against stored patterns..."

Read the assessment protocol:
```
Read <arn-code-plugin-root>/skills/arn-code-assess/references/assessment-protocol.md
```

**Agent invocations — launch all applicable agents in parallel:**

**Always invoke the `arn-code-architect` agent** via the Task tool, passing the model from `.arness/agent-models/code.md` as the `model` parameter (see `plugins/arn-code/skills/arn-code-ensure-config/references/ensure-config.md` "Dispatch convention" for fallback). Context:
- The architect assessment prompt template from the protocol
- Codebase context: full content of `code-patterns.md`, `testing-patterns.md`, `architecture.md`
- Scope: the scope from G1

**If `has_ui_patterns` is true**, also invoke the `arn-code-ux-specialist` agent via the Task tool, passing the model from `.arness/agent-models/code.md` as the `model` parameter (see `plugins/arn-code/skills/arn-code-ensure-config/references/ensure-config.md` "Dispatch convention" for fallback). Context:
- The UX specialist assessment prompt template from the protocol
- Context: `ui-patterns.md`, `architecture.md`, `code-patterns.md`
- Scope from G1

**If `has_security_patterns` is true**, also invoke the `arn-code-security-specialist` agent via the Task tool, passing the model from `.arness/agent-models/code.md` as the `model` parameter (see `plugins/arn-code/skills/arn-code-ensure-config/references/ensure-config.md` "Dispatch convention" for fallback). Context:
- The security specialist assessment prompt template from the protocol
- Context: `security-patterns.md`, `architecture.md`, `code-patterns.md`
- Scope from G1

All applicable agents are invoked in parallel (single message, multiple Agent tool calls).

**After all agents return:**

Follow the merge, deduplication, ID assignment, and report generation procedures defined in the assessment protocol. Write the assessment report to `<specs-dir>/ASSESSMENT_<scope-name>.md`.

Present the findings to the user grouped by category with severity indicators.

**If no findings:** "Assessment found no significant deviations from stored patterns. Your codebase is in good shape!" — exit gracefully.

---

### Step 4: Gate G2 — Prioritize

Show progress:
```
Arness Assess: scope → assess → PRIORITIZE → spec(s) → plan → save → execute → test → ship                                ^^^^^^^^^^
```

Ask: "These are the assessment findings. Ready to prioritize, or would you like to investigate any finding further?"

If the user wants to investigate: discuss the specific finding, read relevant files, provide more context. Return to this gate when done.

Present findings as a numbered list (grouped by severity: high first). Ask:

**"Select which improvements to implement (comma-separated numbers, 'all', or 'all high'):"**

After selection, proceed to G3.

---

### Step 5: Gate G3 — Spec Strategy

Ask with `user prompt`:

**"How should these improvements be organized into specifications?"**

Options:
1. **Bundle all into one spec** — Single feature spec covering all selected improvements
2. **Create separate specs** — One spec per improvement
3. **Let Arness suggest groupings** — Group by affected module or theme

**If "Let Arness suggest groupings":**
- Group findings that share affected files or are in the same architectural area
- Present the suggested groups: "Group 1: [finding IDs] — [theme]. Group 2: [finding IDs] — [theme]."
- Ask the user to confirm or adjust the groupings

Store the final bundles as `spec_bundles` — a list where each entry has a name and a list of finding IDs.

---

### Step 6: Create Specs

Show progress:
```
Arness Assess: scope → assess → prioritize → SPEC(s) → plan → save → execute → test → ship                                            ^^^^^^^
```

For each bundle in `spec_bundles`:

Compose a feature description from the bundled findings:
- Title: "Improve [primary category]: [brief summary of findings]"
- Body: List each finding's description and suggested approach
- Context: Reference the assessment report for full details

Invoke Codex skill `arn-code-feature-spec` with the composed description as context.

After each spec is created, track the spec filename in `spec_list`.

If `arn-code-feature-spec` fails for a bundle, offer to split into individual findings and retry.

---

### Step 7: Plan All

Show progress:
```
Arness Assess: scope → assess → prioritize → spec(s) → PLAN → save → execute → test → ship                                                       ^^^^
```

Inform: "Generating plans for all specs..."

For each spec in `spec_list`:
- Invoke Codex skill `arn-code-plan <spec-name>`
- Track the plan preview path

---

### Step 8: Gate G4 — Review Plans

Present all generated plans with a brief summary of each (phase count, task count, estimated scope).

Ask with `user prompt`:

**"Plans are ready. How would you like to proceed?"**

Options:
1. **Approve all plans** — Proceed to save and execute
2. **Revise a plan** — Re-invoke arn-code-plan with feedback for a specific spec
3. **Remove a spec** — Drop a spec from the pipeline

If **Revise**: ask which plan and what feedback, re-invoke `arn-code:arn-code-plan`, return to this gate.
If **Remove**: mark the spec as `skipped` in state tracking, return to this gate with remaining plans.
Continue until the user approves.

---

### Step 9: Save All (auto)

Show progress:
```
Arness Assess: scope → assess → prioritize → spec(s) → plan → SAVE → execute → test → ship                                                               ^^^^
```

Inform: "Converting plans to structured projects..."

For each approved plan:
- Invoke Codex skill `arn-code-save-plan`

---

### Step 10: Sequential Taskify + Execute

Show progress:
```
Arness Assess: scope → assess → prioritize → spec(s) → plan → save → EXECUTE → test → ship                                                                     ^^^^^^^
```

Read the orchestration flow:
```
Read <arn-code-plugin-root>/skills/arn-code-assess/references/orchestration-flow.md
```

**Determine execution order** using the ordering heuristic from the orchestration flow. Present the suggested order and allow the user to override.

**For each spec in execution order:**

1. **Conflict check** (skip for the first spec):
   - Compare files modified by previously executed specs against files referenced in this spec's phase plans
   - Follow the conflict detection algorithm from the orchestration flow
   - If conflicts detected → **Gate G5**: Present conflicts using the format from the orchestration flow. Ask with `user prompt`:
     - **Re-plan** — Re-invoke `arn-code:arn-code-plan` and `arn-code:arn-code-save-plan` for this spec
     - **Proceed anyway** — Execute the existing plan
     - **Skip this spec** — Mark as skipped, move to next

2. **Taskify**: Invoke Codex skill `arn-code-taskify`

3. **Execute**: Invoke Codex skill `arn-code-execute-plan`

4. **Track results**: Collect execution reports, extract list of files modified, update spec state

If execution fails mid-spec:
- Present the failure
- Ask: Retry / Skip remaining tasks in this spec / Abort pipeline

---

### Step 11: Test

Show progress:
```
Arness Assess: scope → assess → prioritize → spec(s) → plan → save → execute → TEST → ship                                                                                ^^^^
```

Invoke the `arn-code-test-specialist` agent via the Agent tool, passing the model from `.arness/agent-models/code.md` as the `model` parameter (see `plugins/arn-code/skills/arn-code-ensure-config/references/ensure-config.md` "Dispatch convention" for fallback). Context:
- **Scope:** "full suite"
- **Code patterns directory:** the configured code-patterns path

**Gate G6 — based on verdict:**

**If ALL PASSING:** "All tests pass. Ready to ship."

**If FAILURES DETECTED or ERRORS DETECTED:**
- Present the failures from the test report
- Ask with `user prompt`:

  **"Tests have failures. How would you like to proceed?"**

  Options:
  1. **Fix and re-test** — User fixes the issues, then re-invoke `arn-code-test-specialist`
  2. **Proceed despite failures** — Continue to ship (warn: not recommended)
  3. **Abort** — Stop the pipeline, show what was completed

Loop on option 1 until tests pass or user chooses another option.

---

### Step 12: Gate G7 — Ship

Show progress:
```
Arness Assess: scope → assess → prioritize → spec(s) → plan → save → execute → test → SHIP                                                                                      ^^^^
```

Ask with `user prompt`:

**"Ready to ship?"**

Options:
1. **Commit, push & create PR** — Full ship workflow
2. **Just commit** — Commit locally without pushing
3. **Not yet** — Exit without shipping (can run `arn-code-ship` later)

If **Commit, push & create PR** or **Just commit:**
→ Codex skill `arn-code-ship`

If **Not yet:** show what was completed and inform the user they can ship later.

---

### Step 13: Complete

Show final progress:
```
Arness Assess: scope → assess → prioritize → spec(s) → plan → save → execute → test → ship
               ✓       ✓          ✓           ✓         ✓      ✓       ✓        ✓      ✓
```

Present completion summary:

- **Assessment:** N findings across N categories (H high, M medium, L low)
- **Selected:** N improvements (of N total findings)
- **Specs created:** [list of spec names]
- **Specs executed:** [count] executed, [count] skipped
- **Tests:** [verdict]
- **Ship:** [PR URL / commit hash / deferred]

"Assessment pipeline complete. Run `arn-code-assess` again anytime to review your codebase."

---

## Error Handling

- **Sub-skill fails:** Present the error. Ask: retry / skip / abort. If retry, re-invoke. If skip, continue to next gate. If abort, show what was completed and exit.
- **Agent returns empty findings:** Report that the agent found no issues in its domain. Continue with findings from other agents.
- **No findings at all:** Exit gracefully with positive message (see Step 3).
- **User says "stop" or "pause":** Show what has been completed. Inform user they can resume by running `arn-code-assess` again (artifact detection will pick up).
- **Conflict detection finds massive overlap (5+ files across 3+ specs):** Warn and suggest re-bundling remaining specs into a single combined spec.
- **Arness not configured:** Block and suggest running `arn-assessing` to get started.
- **Multiple assessment files detected during resume:** List them and ask which to resume.

## Constraints

- This skill MUST NOT duplicate sub-skill or agent logic. It only handles sequencing, decision gates, and multi-spec orchestration.
- All pipeline work is done by invoked skills (via Codex skill invocation) and agents (via Agent tool).
- Progress display uses the compact format shown above — one line with the current stage highlighted.
- The skill runs in normal conversation (not plan mode).
- Assessment agents are invoked in parallel (single message, multiple Agent tool calls).
- Spec execution is always sequential with conflict detection between specs.
