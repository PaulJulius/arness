# Arness Knowledge Base

Reference documentation for the `arn-code-doctor` agent. Describes the Arness plugin's pipeline, configuration requirements, expected file structures, common failure modes, and inter-skill data flow.

## Pipeline Map

```
arn-code-init → arn-code-feature-spec / arn-code-bug-spec → arn-code-plan → arn-code-save-plan → arn-code-review-plan → arn-code-taskify → arn-code-execute-plan → arn-code-review-implementation → arn-code-document-project → arn-code-ship
```

Three ceremony tiers (selected by scope router in arn-planning):
- **Swift** (low ceremony): `arn-code-swift` — quick assessment → plan → execute → simplify → verify → ship (1-8 files)
- **Standard** (medium ceremony): `arn-code-standard` — spec-lite → plan → execute → review-lite → ship (collapsed pipeline)
- **Thorough** (full ceremony): Full pipeline above (spec → plan → save → taskify → execute → review → docs → ship)

Alternative paths:
- `arn-code-feature-spec-teams` — team debate variant of feature spec
- `arn-code-execute-plan-teams` — Agent Teams variant of execution (requires CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1)
- `arn-code-execute-task` — single task execution (alternative to full plan execution)
- `arn-code-standard` — collapsed spec-plan-execute for medium complexity (standard tier)
- `arn-code-review-pr` — PR feedback loop (standalone, requires Platform: github or bitbucket)
- `arn-code-create-issue` / `arn-code-pick-issue` — issue management (standalone, requires Issue tracker: github or jira)
- `arn-code-catch-up` -- retroactive documentation of out-of-pipeline commits (standalone)
- `arn-code-report` — diagnostic reporting (standalone)

## Config Requirements

The `## Arness` section in CLAUDE.md can have up to 14 fields (11 core + 3 conditional: 2 Jira + 1 Task list ID). Each skill reads specific fields:

| Skill | Plans dir | Specs dir | Templates | Code patterns | Docs dir | Git | Platform | Issue tracker | Jira site | Jira project | Task list ID |
|-------|-----------|-----------|-----------|---------------|----------|-----|----------|---------------|-----------|--------------|--------------|
| arn-code-init | creates | creates | creates | creates | creates | detects | detects | detects | detects | detects | creates |
| arn-code-feature-spec | - | writes to | - | reads | - | - | - | - | - | - | - |
| arn-code-bug-spec | - | writes to | - | reads | - | - | - | - | - | - | - |
| arn-code-save-plan | reads | reads | reads | reads | - | - | - | - | - | - | - |
| arn-code-review-plan | reads | - | - | reads | - | - | - | - | - | - | - |
| arn-code-taskify | reads | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | reads |
| arn-code-execute-plan | reads | reads | reads | reads | - | - | - | - | - | - | reads |
| arn-code-execute-task | reads | reads | reads | reads | - | - | - | - | - | - | - |

| arn-code-document-project | reads | reads | - | reads | writes to | reads | - | - | - | - | - |
| arn-code-ship | - | - | - | - | - | required | github or bitbucket | - | - | - | - |
| arn-code-review-pr | - | - | - | - | - | - | github or bitbucket | (optional) | - | - | - |

## Expected ## Arness Config Format

```markdown
## Arness
- **Plans directory:** <path>
- **Specs directory:** <path>
- **Report templates:** default | custom
- **Template path:** <path>
- **Template version:** <semver>
- **Template updates:** ask | auto | manual
- **Code patterns:** <path>
- **Docs directory:** <path>
- **Git:** yes | no
- **Platform:** github | bitbucket | none
- **Issue tracker:** github | jira | none
- **Jira site:** <site>.atlassian.net          ← only if Issue tracker: jira
- **Jira project:** <KEY>                      ← only if Issue tracker: jira
- **Task list ID:** <id>                        ← only if user opted in during init Step 9b
```

Backward compatibility: Missing `Docs directory` defaults to `.arness/docs/`. Missing `Git` defaults to runtime detection. Legacy `GitHub: yes` is auto-migrated to `Platform: github` + `Issue tracker: github` by the upgrade flow. Missing `Task list ID` means tasks are session-scoped — the upgrade flow (Step U8) offers to enable persistence.

### After arn-code-swift (updated)

The swift directory now also includes a CHANGE_RECORD.json:

```

├── SWIFT_<name>.md (assessment + plan)
├── SWIFT_REPORT.json (execution report)
└── CHANGE_RECORD.json (unified change envelope)

  CATCHUP_<name>.md (what we know / what we don't know summary)
  CHANGE_RECORD.json (unified change envelope with catchup extension)
```

### After arn-code-execute-plan (thorough tier)

```
<plans-dir>/<PROJECT_NAME>/reports/
├── IMPLEMENTATION_REPORT_PHASE_*.json
├── TESTING_REPORT_PHASE_*.json
└── TASK_REVIEW_REPORT_*.json (one per reviewed task)
```

The thorough tier also produces a CHANGE_RECORD.json in the project root:

```
<plans-dir>/<PROJECT_NAME>/
├── ... (existing project files)
└── CHANGE_RECORD.json (unified change envelope)
```

## Common Failure Modes

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Diagnostic Check |
|---------|-------------|------------------|
| "## Arness section not found" | arn-code-init was not run, or CLAUDE.md was deleted/overwritten | Check CLAUDE.md exists at project root and contains `## Arness` |
| Templates not found | Template directory missing or empty after init | Check `<template-path>/` exists and contains JSON files |
| Checksums missing | arn-code-init completed but the checksum generation step was skipped or failed | Check `.checksums.json` exists in template directory |
| Spec not found by arn-code-plan | Specs directory misconfigured, or spec was saved with wrong name/path | Check `<specs-dir>/` exists and list its contents |
| Plan preview not found by save-plan | arn-code-plan was not run, or plan was not approved | Check `<plans-dir>/` for PLAN_PREVIEW_*.md files |
| arn-code-save-plan fails | Plans directory doesn't exist | Check `<plans-dir>/` exists via `ls` |
| TASKS.md has no parseable tasks | TASKS.md format doesn't match expected `### Task N:` heading pattern | Check TASKS.md exists and has correct format |
| Task list empty after arn-code-taskify | TASKS.md was empty or had parsing errors during taskify | Check TASKS.md content for task entries |
| Executor agent fails | Missing phase plan file, INTRODUCTION.md, or project directory structure incomplete | Verify all required project files exist |
| GitHub-dependent skills fail | gh CLI not installed, not authenticated, or no GitHub remote | Run `gh auth status` and `git remote -v` |
| Labels not created during arn-code-init | gh auth lacks permission, or GitHub detection returned no | Check Git/GitHub fields in config, run `gh auth status` |
| PR creation fails in arn-code-ship | Not on a feature branch, no commits ahead of main, or gh not authenticated | Check `git branch --show-current`, `git log main..HEAD`, `gh auth status` |
| Template version mismatch | Plugin was updated but project templates are from an older version | Compare `Template version` in config with version in plugin.json |
| Pattern docs incomplete | arn-code-codebase-analyzer or arn-code-pattern-architect returned partial output | Check pattern doc files exist and have content |
| Bitbucket skills fail | `bkt` not installed or not authenticated | Run `bkt --version` and `bkt auth status` |
| Jira skills fail | Atlassian MCP server not configured or auth expired | Run `/mcp` to check server status, check `.mcp.json` |
| Jira project not found | Wrong project key or MCP auth issue | Verify `Jira project` in config, re-run `arn-planning` to reconfigure |
| PR creation fails on Bitbucket | `bkt` auth expired or wrong workspace | Check `bkt auth status`, verify remote URL |
| Old `GitHub: yes` config | Pre-0.9.0 config not migrated | Run any entry-point skill (e.g., `arn-planning`) — ensure-config auto-migrates legacy fields |
| STANDARD_* artifacts not detected | arn-code-standard directory uses wrong prefix or naming | Check `<plans-dir>/` for directories matching `STANDARD_*` pattern; verify `STANDARD_<name>.md` exists inside |
| CHANGE_RECORD.json missing | Tier skill completed but did not generate the unified change envelope | Check the tier output directory (SWIFT_*, STANDARD_*, or project root) for CHANGE_RECORD.json; re-run the tier skill if missing |
| Standard tier not offered by scope router | Scope router criteria not updated or severity score calculation incorrect | Check `references/scope-router-criteria.md` in arn-planning for the 6-criterion weighted scoring thresholds |
