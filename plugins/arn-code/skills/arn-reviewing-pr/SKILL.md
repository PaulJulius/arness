# Arness Reviewing PR

Validate PR review comments, categorize findings, and fix or defer issues. This is a first-citizen entry point that wraps `arn-code-review-pr` and provides chaining context back to `arn-implementing` if fixes are needed.

This skill is a **thin orchestration wrapper**. It MUST NOT duplicate `arn-code-review-pr` logic. All review work is done by the invoked skill. Arness-reviewing-pr handles: prerequisite checks, input routing, invoking the review skill, and offering the chain exit.

## Step 0: Ensure Configuration

Read `<arn-code-plugin-root>/skills/arn-code-ensure-config/references/step-0-fast-path.md` and follow its instructions. This guarantees a user profile exists and `## Arness` is configured with Arness Code fields before proceeding.

After Step 0 completes, extract the following from `## Arness`:
- **Platform** — determines if PR operations are available (`github`, `bitbucket`, or `none`)

If Platform is `none`: inform the user that no platform is configured and suggest running `arn-reviewing-pr` again after configuring a platform. Do not proceed.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Input Handling

- **PR number provided** (e.g., "reviewing pr 42", "arness reviewing pr #123"): Extract the PR number and pass it to the review skill.
- **No args**: Auto-detect PR for current branch (the review skill handles this internally).
- **No PR found**: The review skill will detect this and inform the user. Suggest running `arn-shipping` to create a PR first.

### Step 2: Invoke Review PR

Show progress:
```
Reviewing PR: REVIEW-PR -> [fix / defer / plan]
              ^^^^^^^^^
```

Invoke the review skill:

> Codex skill `arn-code-review-pr` [optional PR number]

The review skill handles all internal decisions: fetching comments, validating findings, categorizing, and optionally fixing. It has its own user interactions. Wait for it to complete.

---

### Step 3: Completion Handoff

After `arn-code-review-pr` completes, assess what happened and offer the appropriate chain exit.

**If fixes were applied:**

Ask the user:

**"Review complete. What next?"**

Options:
1. **Push updates** — Push the fixes to the PR
2. **More substantial fixes needed** — Start implementing for more complex changes
3. **Done** — Exit

If **Push updates**: Run `git push` to update the PR.
If **More substantial fixes needed**: Codex skill `arn-implementing`
If **Done**: Exit.

**If no fixes were needed (all deferred or no actionable findings):**

Exit with: "Review complete. No fixes needed."

## Error Handling

- **`## Arness` config missing:** Handled by Step 0 (ensure-config) — this should not occur if Step 0 completed successfully.
- **Platform not configured:** Inform the user. Suggest running `arn-reviewing-pr` again after platform configuration.
- **No PR for current branch:** Suggest running `arn-shipping` to create one.
- **`arn-code-review-pr` fails:** Present the error. Ask: retry or abort.
- **Auth failure (GitHub/Bitbucket):** The review skill handles auth errors internally. No action needed at this level.
