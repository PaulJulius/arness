# Arness Execute Plan Teams

Execute a structured project plan using Claude Code's experimental Agent Teams feature. Creates a coordinated team of executor, reviewer, and architect teammates that work together on task implementation. Each task goes through an implement->review->gate cycle within the team.

Pipeline position:
```
arn-code-taskify -> **arn-code-execute-plan-teams** (team: execute -> review -> architect consult -> gate) -> arn-code-review-implementation
```

This is an alternative to `arn-code-execute-plan` (subagent-based). Use this when:
- You want tighter executor<->reviewer collaboration (direct messaging between teammates)
- You want an on-call architect for architectural questions during implementation
- You're working on a complex multi-phase project where quality gates matter most
- You accept 3-7x higher token usage for better coordination

## Prerequisites

If no `## Arness` section exists in the project's CLAUDE.md, inform the user: "Arness is not configured for this project yet. Run `arn-implementing` to get started — it will set everything up automatically." Do not proceed without it. Task list must exist (run `arn-code-taskify` first).

## Workflow

### Step 1: Check Agent Teams Availability

Run via Bash: `echo $CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS`

**If the variable is not set, is empty, or is set to "0" or "false":**
Inform the user: "This skill requires Claude Code's experimental Agent Teams feature."

Provide setup instructions:
- Add to `~/.claude/settings.json` under `"env"`:
  ```json
  "CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS": "1"
  ```
- Or set the environment variable before running Claude Code:
  ```bash
  CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1 claude
  ```

Suggest the alternative: "You can use `arn-code-execute-plan` instead, which uses subagents and doesn't require Agent Teams."

**If enabled:** proceed to Step 2.

### Step 2: Load Configuration and Verify Project

1. Read the project's CLAUDE.md and extract the `## Arness` section to find:
   - **Plans directory** -- base path where project plans are saved
   - **Code patterns** -- path to the directory containing stored pattern documentation
   - **Template path** -- path to the report template set (JSON templates)
   - **Template version** -- plugin version the templates were copied from (if present)
   - **Template updates** -- user preference: `ask`, `auto`, or `manual` (if present)
   - **Specs directory** -- path to the directory containing specification files (if present)

   **Template version check:** If `Template version` and `Template updates` fields are present, run the template version check procedure documented in arn-code-save-plan Step 1 (Template Version Check) before proceeding. If `## Arness` does not contain these fields, treat as legacy and skip.

2. Ask the user for `PROJECT_NAME` if not provided in the trigger message

3. Verify the project directory exists and contains the required structure:
   ```
   <plans-dir>/<PROJECT_NAME>/
   ├── INTRODUCTION.md
   ├── TASKS.md
   ├── PROGRESS_TRACKER.json
   ├── plans/PHASE_*.md
   └── reports/
   ```

4. If the project directory is missing, suggest running `arn-code-save-plan` first
5. If PROGRESS_TRACKER.json is missing, warn that progress tracking will not be available. Execution can still proceed.

6. Call `TaskList` to check for existing tasks
   - If **no tasks exist**, tell the user to run `arn-code-taskify` first
   - If **tasks already exist with progress**, show state and:

     Ask the user:

     **"Tasks already exist with progress. How would you like to proceed?"**

     Options:
     1. **Resume** -- Continue execution from where it left off, picking up the next pending unblocked task
     2. **Restart** -- Reset task statuses to pending (existing reports will be preserved; confirm before proceeding)

### Step 3: Create the Team

> **Note:** Teammates should not claim tasks until Step 4 completes. The lead notifies the team when the task list is structured.

Create ONE team for the entire execution. Determine team size based on the number of unblocked parallel tasks:
- **1-3 unblocked tasks:** 1 executor teammate
- **4+ unblocked tasks:** 2 executor teammates (more executors add coordination overhead without proportional speedup)

Team composition:

**Executor teammate(s)** (1-2 instances based on task count):
- Role: Claims pending unblocked IMPL tasks, implements them, writes tests, runs targeted tests
- Spawn prompt includes:
  - Project name: `<PROJECT_NAME>`
  - Project folder path: `<plans-dir>/<PROJECT_NAME>/`
  - INTRODUCTION.md path (with instruction to read it first)
  - Code patterns directory path (with instruction to read code-patterns.md, testing-patterns.md, architecture.md, and ui-patterns.md if present)
  - Phase plan directory path
  - Report template path
  - Testing instructions: write tests if planned, run ONLY targeted tests (precise test file/function targeting: `pytest tests/test_specific.py::TestClass`, `jest --testPathPattern=specific.test.ts`), optionally broader module scope, NEVER full test suite
  - Task workflow: claim pending unblocked IMPL tasks from the shared task list via TaskUpdate, implement, test, generate implementation report to `<project-folder>/reports/`, mark IMPL task as completed via TaskUpdate
  - If the project has `### Visual Testing` configured in CLAUDE.md, include Layer 1 visual testing config (top-level fields only: capture script path, compare script path, baseline directory, diff threshold) in the spawn prompt. Instruct the executor to capture screenshots after implementing UI tasks, same as the dispatch loop executor.
- Model: Opus

**Reviewer teammate** (1 instance):
- Role: Claims unblocked REVIEW tasks, validates completed implementations, re-runs tests, classifies findings
- Spawn prompt includes:
  - Same project context as executor
  - TASK_REVIEW_REPORT_TEMPLATE.json path (from template path directory)
  - Review instructions: claim REVIEW tasks when they unblock (after corresponding IMPL completes), read the implementation report, re-run targeted tests, check pattern compliance and acceptance criteria, generate task review report to `<project-folder>/reports/`
  - Verdict logic: pass (mark REVIEW task complete) / pass-with-warnings (append warnings to implementation report, mark complete) / needs-fixes (message the executor directly with specific findings to fix, do NOT mark complete)
  - If the executor reported visual capture paths, include them along with Layer 1 visual testing config (top-level fields only: compare script path, baseline directory, diff threshold). Instruct the reviewer to run visual comparison against baselines and classify regressions, same as the dispatch loop reviewer.
  - Do NOT modify implementation files -- reviewer uses Bash only for running tests
- Model: Opus

**Architect teammate** (1 instance, on-call):
- Role: Consulted for architectural disputes, critical design questions, pattern clarification
- Spawn prompt includes:
  - architecture.md content (read and include in prompt)
  - code-patterns.md content (read and include in prompt)
  - ui-patterns.md content (read and include in prompt, if it exists)
  - INTRODUCTION.md content (read and include in prompt)
  - Instruction: remain idle until messaged by reviewer or executor. When consulted, provide architectural guidance based on documented patterns and decisions. Do not implement code. Do not claim tasks.
- Model: Opus (strategic reasoning)
- Initially idle -- activated only when reviewer or executor messages with an architectural question

### Step 4: Structure the Shared Task List

For each existing task in the Claude Code task list, create a corresponding REVIEW task:

For Task N (already in task list):
1. Rename/annotate as `IMPL-N: [original description]` if needed for clarity
2. Create `REVIEW-N: Review implementation of Task N` via TaskCreate
   - Block REVIEW-N on IMPL-N via TaskUpdate with addBlockedBy
   - Preserve original dependency chain for IMPL tasks

This creates pairs:
```
IMPL-1 (unblocked) -> REVIEW-1 (blocked by IMPL-1)
IMPL-2 (blocked by IMPL-1) -> REVIEW-2 (blocked by IMPL-2)
...
```

Executor teammates claim IMPL tasks via TaskUpdate (set status to in_progress). Reviewer teammate claims REVIEW tasks as they unblock.

### Step 5: Monitor and Coordinate

The lead (main session) monitors:
- **Task list progress** -- call TaskList periodically (every 30-60 seconds) to check for stalled tasks
- **Progress tracker** -- after each task is marked completed by the reviewer, the lead reads `<project-folder>/PROGRESS_TRACKER.json`, updates the matching phase entry status to `"completed"` with a `completedAt` timestamp and the review verdict/cycles, and writes it back to disk. This keeps the tracker current during team execution.
- **Teammate health** -- if a teammate goes idle unexpectedly, investigate
- **Review outcomes** -- if reviewer reports needs-fixes:
  - The reviewer messages the executor directly with findings
  - Executor fixes, reviewer re-reviews
  - If fix cycle exceeds 2 iterations, lead intervenes and escalates to user
- **Architect activation** -- if architect remains idle but should be consulted, the lead can message the reviewer to consult the architect on a specific issue

Intervention triggers:
- Teammate idle for extended period with pending tasks available
- Circular messaging (executor and reviewer stuck in a loop)
- All REVIEW tasks returning needs-fixes repeatedly
- Any teammate crash or error

### Step 6: Completion

When all IMPL and REVIEW tasks are completed:
- Finalize PROGRESS_TRACKER.json:
  - Read `<project-folder>/PROGRESS_TRACKER.json`
  - Verify all phase statuses are up to date (set any remaining phases with completed IMPL/REVIEW tasks to `"completed"`)
  - Set `overallStatus` to `"completed"` and update `lastUpdated`
  - Write PROGRESS_TRACKER.json to disk
- If the project has `### Visual Testing` configured in CLAUDE.md, include a visual testing summary: screenshots captured, baselines updated, visual diffs detected. Note any Layer 1 visual regressions that were flagged during execution.

**Pattern refresh (auto):** After finalizing progress tracking, refresh stored pattern documentation.

> Read `<arn-code-plugin-root>/skills/arn-code-execute-plan/references/pattern-refresh.md` and follow the pattern refresh procedure.

This is automatic and non-blocking. If the refresh fails, note it in the summary but do not block completion.

- Present summary: total tasks, pass rate on first review, fix cycles needed, reports generated
- Show: "Progress tracker finalized in `<project-folder>/PROGRESS_TRACKER.json`"
- List all reports in `<project-folder>/reports/`
- Note token usage if available
- Offer: "Would you like to run `arn-code-review-implementation` for a full project review?"

## Error Handling

- **Agent Teams not enabled** -- provide setup instructions, suggest `arn-code-execute-plan` as alternative
- **`## Arness` config missing in CLAUDE.md** -- suggest running `arn-implementing` to get started
- **Project directory missing** -- suggest running `arn-code-save-plan` to create the project structure
- **No tasks in TaskList** -- suggest running `arn-code-taskify` to convert TASKS.md into tasks
- **Teammate crashes** -- lead reports issue, suggests retrying the failed task or falling back to subagent mode (`arn-code-execute-plan`)
- **Teammates deadlocked** -- lead intervenes with clarifying message, breaks the cycle
- **Executor and reviewer stuck in fix loop (>2 cycles)** -- lead escalates to user with findings
- **Architect unresponsive** -- lead messages architect directly, or provides architectural guidance itself based on pattern docs
- **Token budget exceeded** -- warn user, suggest completing remaining tasks with `arn-code-execute-plan` (lower cost)
- **Task list inconsistency** -- if IMPL/REVIEW pairs get out of sync, lead reconciles by checking task statuses and re-aligning

## Cost Considerations

Agent Teams use significantly more tokens than the subagent-based arn-code-execute-plan. Expect:
- ~3-4x tokens for a 3-teammate team working 30 minutes
- ~5-7x tokens when teammates use plan mode extensively
- Each teammate is a full Claude Code session with its own context window

To keep costs manageable:
- All teammates use Opus. The architect's cost is justified by its strategic role — it stays idle until consulted.
- Shut down the team promptly when all tasks complete
- For simpler projects (fewer than 5 tasks, no complex dependencies), prefer `arn-code-execute-plan` instead
