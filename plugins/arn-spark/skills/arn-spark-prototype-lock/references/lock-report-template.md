# Lock Report Template

This template defines the structure for the `LOCKED.md` manifest file written by the `arn-spark-prototype-lock` skill. The manifest is saved to `[prototypes-dir]/locked/LOCKED.md` and documents the frozen prototype snapshot.

## Template

```markdown
# Prototype Lock Manifest

Locked by `arn-spark-prototype-lock` on [date].

## What is Locked

The locked directory contains:
- **Prototype source code** -- all components, routes, styles, and configuration
- **Lockfile** -- exact dependency versions for reproducible builds
- **Validation evidence** -- review reports, judge reports, journey screenshots, showcase
- **Criteria document** -- agreed validation criteria

## What is NOT Locked

- `node_modules/` -- excluded from the copy (reinstall via lockfile)
- Framework build output (`.svelte-kit/`, `.next/`, `dist/`) -- excluded (rebuild from source)
- Runtime state, caches, and temporary files

## Protected by

- **CLAUDE.md rules:** `### Prototype Lock > #### Protected Paths` in the project's CLAUDE.md
- **PreToolUse hook:** [yes / no] -- blocks Write/Edit operations targeting locked directories
