# Spark Knowledge Base

Reference documentation for the `arn-spark-doctor` agent. Describes the Arness Spark plugin's pipeline, configuration requirements, expected file structures, common failure modes, and inter-skill data flow.

## Pipeline Map

### Main Pipeline (Brainstorming Wizard)

```
discover → stress-test → concept-review → naming → arch-vision → use-cases → scaffold → spike → visual-sketch → style-explore → static-prototype → clickable-prototype → prototype-lock → feature-extract
```

The `arn-brainstorming` wizard walks through this pipeline with decision gates, detecting progress and offering to resume at the correct stage.

### Stress Testing Suite

Four stress test skills run after discovery and before concept review:

```
discover → stress-interview ──┐
         → stress-competitive ─┤
         → stress-premortem ───┤ → concept-review
         → stress-prfaq ───────┘
```

Stress tests can run in parallel and produce independent reports. Concept review synthesizes all available stress test findings.

### Teams Variants

- `arn-spark-use-cases-teams` — team debate variant of use case authoring
- `arn-spark-static-prototype-teams` — team debate variant of static prototype validation
- `arn-spark-clickable-prototype-teams` — team debate variant of clickable prototype validation

### Standalone Skills

- `arn-spark-dev-setup` — development environment setup (can run independently after scaffold)
- `arn-spark-visual-strategy` — visual testing strategy with layered validation
- `arn-spark-visual-readiness` — visual readiness checkpoint for deferred layer activation

### Entry Point

- `arn-brainstorming` — guided wizard that walks through the entire greenfield pipeline with decision gates, detects resume point

## Config Requirements

The `## Arness` section in CLAUDE.md includes Spark-specific fields. Each skill reads specific fields:

## Common Failure Modes

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Diagnostic Check |
|---------|-------------|------------------|
| product-concept.md not found after discovery | arn-spark-discover did not complete, or Vision directory misconfigured | Check `<vision-dir>/product-concept.md` exists |
| Stress test reports not in expected directory | Reports directory misconfigured, or stress test did not complete | Check `<reports-dir>/` for `stress-*-report.md` files |
| naming-brief.md incomplete (no Final Decision section) | Naming skill did not reach Step 4 (due diligence), or user exited early | Check `<vision-dir>/naming-brief.md` for "Final Decision" heading |
| Scaffold fails (npm/yarn install errors, framework init fails) | Missing Node.js, wrong version, network issues, or framework CLI not available | Run `node --version`, `npm --version`, check network |
| Playwright not available for prototyping | Playwright not installed or not in PATH | Run `npx playwright --version` |
| Visual sketch server won't start | Scaffold not completed, dev server config broken, or port conflict | Check scaffold output exists, dev server is runnable |
| Style brief not generated from visual direction | visual-direction.md missing in Vision directory, or style-explore did not complete | Check `<vision-dir>/visual-direction.md` exists |
| Static/clickable prototype build fails | Missing dependencies, scaffold incomplete, or style tokens not applied | Check `node_modules/` exists, scaffold files present |
| Feature extraction finds no upstream artifacts | No product concept, no use cases, no prototype validation reports | Check Vision, Use cases, Prototypes directories for expected files |
| Visual testing layer activation fails | Visual grounding directory missing or empty, visual strategy not run | Check `<visual-grounding-dir>/` exists and contains assets |
| Figma/Canva MCP not available | MCP server not configured for design tool integration | Check `.mcp.json` for design tool entries |
| Use case files not in expected format | Use cases written manually instead of via arn-spark-use-cases skill | Check `<use-cases-dir>/` for `UC-*.md` pattern |
| Prototype lock LOCKED.md missing | arn-spark-prototype-lock did not complete or Prototypes directory misconfigured | Check `<prototypes-dir>/LOCKED.md` exists |
| Brainstorming wizard can't detect resume point | Artifacts in unexpected locations, config directories changed after initial run | Check all configured directories match where artifacts were actually written |
| ensure-config fails to create Spark fields | CLAUDE.md not writable, or `## Arness` section has unexpected format | Check CLAUDE.md exists and is writable, check `## Arness` section format |
