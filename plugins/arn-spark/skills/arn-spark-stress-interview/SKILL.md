# Arness Spark Stress Interview

Stress-test a product concept by conducting structured synthetic user interviews. This skill generates 3 synthetic personas from the product concept's persona moulds, applies adversarial casting overlays (Pragmatist, Skeptic, Power User), and runs each through a 3-phase "Two-Part Reveal" interview protocol:

1. **Phase 1 -- Blind Problem Check:** The persona hears about the problem without knowing the product exists. Do they even care?
2. **Phase 2 -- Elevator Pitch Reveal:** The full product concept is revealed. What resonates? What falls flat? What is missing?
3. **Phase 3 -- Dealbreaker Probe:** The weakest aspects are presented head-on. Would they still use this?

The process produces brutally honest feedback from 3 distinct adversarial perspectives, synthesized into actionable concept update recommendations. The product concept is read but never modified -- all recommendations are captured in the interview report for later review.

## Prerequisites

### Configuration Check

1. Read the project's `CLAUDE.md` and check for a `## Arness` section
2. If found, extract the configured **Vision directory** and **Reports directory** paths
3. If no `## Arness` section exists or Arness Spark fields are missing, inform the user: "Arness Spark is not configured for this project yet. Run `/arn-brainstorming` to get started — it will set everything up automatically." Do not proceed without it.
4. Create the reports directory structure if it does not exist: `mkdir -p <reports-dir>/stress-tests/`

### Data Availability

| Artifact | Status | Location | Fallback |
|----------|--------|----------|----------|
| Product concept | REQUIRED | `<vision-dir>/product-concept.md` | Cannot proceed without it -- suggest running `/arn-spark-discover` |
| Persona moulds | REQUIRED | Target Personas section of product concept | Fallback cascade below |
| Product pillars | ENRICHES | Product Pillars section of product concept | Interview proceeds but questions are less targeted |
| Competitive landscape | ENRICHES | Competitive Landscape section of product concept | Phase 3 competitive comparison questions are skipped |

**Persona moulds fallback cascade:**

If the product concept exists but the Target Personas section is missing or contains "Not explored" sentinel:

Ask (using `AskUserQuestion`): **"The product concept does not include persona moulds, which are needed to generate synthetic interview subjects. How would you like to proceed?"**
1. Run `/arn-spark-discover` to generate personas through product discovery
2. Describe 3 target user types now (I will generate personas from your descriptions)
3. Skip the interview stress test

If the user chooses option 2, collect brief descriptions and invoke `arn-spark-persona-architect` in **instantiation mode** to generate persona instances with casting overlays before proceeding.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Load References

Load the interview protocol, persona casting spec, and report template:
> Read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/arn-spark-stress-interview/references/interview-protocol.md`
> Read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/arn-spark-stress-interview/references/persona-casting-spec.md`
> Read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/arn-spark-stress-interview/references/interview-report-template.md`

### Step 2: Read Product Concept and Extract Context

Read the product concept from `<vision-dir>/product-concept.md`. Extract:
- Product vision and problem statement (for Phase 1 blind problem check)
- Full product concept summary (for Phase 2 reveal)
- Product pillars (for targeted probing)
- Competitive landscape (for Phase 3 competitive comparisons)
- Persona moulds from the Target Personas section
- Scope boundaries and deferred features (for Phase 3 dealbreaker probes)

### Step 3: Generate Synthetic Personas (Casting)

Select 3 persona moulds from the product concept. If more than 3 moulds exist, select the 3 most diverse in adoption posture and technical sophistication.

For each mould, invoke the `arn-spark-persona-architect` agent in **instantiation mode** via the Task tool, passing the model from `.arness/agent-models/spark.md` as the `model` parameter (see `plugins/arn-spark/skills/arn-spark-ensure-config/references/ensure-config.md` "Dispatch convention" for fallback). Context:

--- PERSONA MOULD ---
[full abstracted profile from product concept]
--- END PERSONA MOULD ---

--- CASTING OVERLAY ---
[overlay specification from persona-casting-spec.md -- one of Pragmatist, Skeptic, Power User]
--- END CASTING OVERLAY ---

--- PRODUCT CONTEXT ---
[product vision and problem statement for domain grounding]
--- END PRODUCT CONTEXT ---

Assign overlays following the priority in the casting spec: natural fit first, then maximize coverage.

Receive back 3 fully detailed concrete personas with casting overlays baked in. Present a brief summary to the user:

"I have generated 3 synthetic interview subjects:
- **[Persona 1 Name]** ([Archetype]) with **Pragmatist** lens -- focused on practical adoption barriers
- **[Persona 2 Name]** ([Archetype]) with **Skeptic** lens -- focused on trust and systemic risk
- **[Persona 3 Name]** ([Archetype]) with **Power User** lens -- focused on depth and scalability

Starting interviews now. Each persona goes through 3 phases: blind problem check, full reveal, and dealbreaker probe."

### Step 4: Conduct Interviews (3 Phases x 3 Personas -- Phase-Parallel)

Run interviews in 3 waves. Each wave runs one phase for all 3 personas in parallel. Each persona's interview context is independent -- no cross-persona information is shared between parallel invocations.

#### Wave 1 -- Phase 1 (Blind Problem Check)

Run all 3 personas' Phase 1 interviews in parallel. For each persona in parallel:

Invoke the `arn-spark-product-strategist` agent via the Task tool, passing the model from `.arness/agent-models/spark.md` as the `model` parameter (see `plugins/arn-spark/skills/arn-spark-ensure-config/references/ensure-config.md` "Dispatch convention" for fallback). Context:

--- PRODUCT CONCEPT ---
[full product concept]
--- END PRODUCT CONCEPT ---

--- INTERVIEW PROTOCOL ---
Phase 1 goal: formulate 2-3 questions that probe problem recognition without revealing the solution. Strip solution-specific language from the problem description.
--- END INTERVIEW PROTOCOL ---

--- PERSONA PROFILE ---
[full cast persona profile]
--- END PERSONA PROFILE ---

Then invoke the `arn-spark-persona-impersonator` agent via the Task tool, passing the model from `.arness/agent-models/spark.md` as the `model` parameter (see `plugins/arn-spark/skills/arn-spark-ensure-config/references/ensure-config.md` "Dispatch convention" for fallback). Context:

--- PERSONA PROFILE ---
[full cast persona profile]
--- END PERSONA PROFILE ---

--- CASTING OVERLAY ---
[overlay name and specification]
--- END CASTING OVERLAY ---

--- PRODUCT CONCEPT SUMMARY ---
[problem space description ONLY -- no product details]
--- END PRODUCT CONCEPT SUMMARY ---

--- INTERVIEW PHASE ---
reaction
--- END INTERVIEW PHASE ---

--- INTERVIEW PROMPT ---
[questions from product strategist]
--- END INTERVIEW PROMPT ---

Record the full response for each persona.

After all 3 personas' Phase 1 responses are collected, proceed to Wave 2.

#### Wave 2 -- Phase 2 (Deep Probing)

After Wave 1 completes, run all 3 personas' Phase 2 interviews in parallel. Each persona's Phase 2 needs only its own Phase 1 context (available from Wave 1). For each persona in parallel:

Invoke `arn-spark-product-strategist` with that persona's Phase 1 responses and the full product concept, requesting Phase 2 questions that target gaps between the persona's described problem and the product's proposed solution.

Then invoke `arn-spark-persona-impersonator` with the full product concept revealed, interview phase set to `probing`, and questions from the strategist. Include that persona's Phase 1 responses as prior context.

Record the full response for each persona.

After all 3 personas' Phase 2 responses are collected, proceed to Wave 3.

#### Wave 3 -- Phase 3 (Stress Test)

After Wave 2 completes, run all 3 personas' Phase 3 interviews in parallel. Each persona's Phase 3 needs only its own Phase 1+2 context. For each persona in parallel:

Invoke `arn-spark-product-strategist` with that persona's Phase 1+2 responses, requesting Phase 3 questions that force the persona to confront known limitations, scope boundaries, and competitive alternatives.

Then invoke `arn-spark-persona-impersonator` with that persona's Phase 1+2 responses as prior context, interview phase set to `stress`, weakest aspects and scope boundaries explicitly highlighted, and questions from the strategist.

Record the full response for each persona.

### Step 5: Synthesize Findings

After all 9 interviews are complete, invoke the `arn-spark-product-strategist` agent via the Task tool, passing the model from `.arness/agent-models/spark.md` as the `model` parameter (see `plugins/arn-spark/skills/arn-spark-ensure-config/references/ensure-config.md` "Dispatch convention" for fallback). Context:

--- PRODUCT CONCEPT ---
[full product concept]
--- END PRODUCT CONCEPT ---

--- PRODUCT PILLARS ---
[product pillars section]
--- END PRODUCT PILLARS ---

--- INTERVIEW TRANSCRIPTS ---
[all 9 persona-impersonator responses organized by persona and phase]
--- END INTERVIEW TRANSCRIPTS ---

--- SYNTHESIS TASK ---
1. Identify 3-5 cross-persona themes (patterns observed across multiple personas and casting overlays)
2. Draft a Recommended Concept Updates table using the standardized schema: | # | Section | Current State | Recommended Change | Type | Rationale |
3. Identify Unresolved Questions that emerged from interviews but cannot be answered without real user data
--- END SYNTHESIS TASK ---

### Step 6: Assemble and Write Report

Using the interview report template:
1. Populate all sections with interview data and strategist synthesis
2. Include the full transcript of all 9 interviews
3. If `<reports-dir>/stress-tests/interview-report.md` already exists, inform the user: "A previous interview report exists. It will be overwritten (git preserves history)."
4. Write the report to `<reports-dir>/stress-tests/interview-report.md`

Present a summary to the user:

"Interview stress test complete. Report saved to `[path]`.

**Key findings:**
- [Finding 1 -- most impactful theme]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

**Recommended concept updates:** [N] recommendations ([X] Add, [Y] Modify, [Z] Remove)
**Unresolved questions:** [N]

This report will be used by `/arn-spark-concept-review` to propose changes to the product concept."

## Error Handling

- **Persona architect returns generic personas:** Retry with more specific mould details and casting overlay instructions. If retry fails:
  Ask (using `AskUserQuestion`): **"Persona generation produced generic results. How would you like to proceed?"**
  1. Retry with additional context
  2. Skip this persona and continue with remaining
  3. Abort the interview stress test

- **Persona impersonator breaks character:** Retry once with a simplified prompt that re-emphasizes the persona profile and casting overlay. If retry fails, record what was captured and note the gap in the report. Continue with remaining phases/personas.

- **Persona impersonator breaks character (persistent):** After retry failure:
  Ask (using `AskUserQuestion`): **"The persona impersonator is not maintaining character. How would you like to proceed?"**
  1. Retry this phase
  2. Skip this phase and continue
  3. Abort the interview stress test

- **Product strategist returns unhelpful questions:** Use the interview protocol's question types directly as fallback questions. Note in the report that strategist-formulated questions were replaced with protocol defaults.

- **Any agent invocation fails entirely:** Retry once with a simplified prompt. If retry fails:
  Ask (using `AskUserQuestion`): **"Agent invocation failed. How would you like to proceed?"**
  1. Retry
  2. Skip this step
  3. Abort

## Constraints

- **Read-only with respect to product-concept.md.** The interview skill reads the product concept but NEVER modifies it. All recommendations are captured in the interview report.
- **Phase-parallel interviews.** Each phase runs for all 3 personas in parallel before advancing to the next phase. Each persona's interview context is independent -- no cross-persona information is shared between parallel invocations.
- **All 3 casting overlays must be represented.** If fewer than 3 moulds exist, the skill still generates 3 personas (reusing moulds with different overlays if necessary) to ensure Pragmatist, Skeptic, and Power User perspectives are all captured.
- **Report overwrites on re-run.** If `interview-report.md` already exists, it is overwritten. Git provides history.
