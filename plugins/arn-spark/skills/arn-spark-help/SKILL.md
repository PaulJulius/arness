# Arness Spark Help

Detect the user's current position in the Arness Spark exploration pipeline, render a diagram with the active stage marked, and suggest the next command to run. Supports cross-plugin awareness — detects activity in Arness Code and Arness Infra and provides hints at the bottom of the output. This skill is strictly read-only — it never modifies files or project state.

**Allowed tools:** Read, Glob, Grep only. This skill MUST NOT use Write, Edit, Bash, or Task tools. This skill MUST NOT invoke any agents.

## Workflow

### Step 0: Multi-Plugin Awareness

1. Read the project's `CLAUDE.md` file.
2. Extract the `## Arness` section.
3. Detect other plugin field groups:
   - **code_fields_present**: true if `Plans directory` OR `Specs directory` present in `## Arness`
   - **infra_fields_present**: true if `Infra plans directory` OR `Infra specs directory` present in `## Arness`
4. For each detected plugin, do a quick existence check (max 2 files):
   - **Code**: Check if `<Specs directory>` contains any `FEATURE_*.md` or `BUGFIX_*.md`, OR `<Plans directory>` has any subdirectories
   - **Infra**: Check if `<Infra plans directory>` has any subdirectories, OR if `Dockerfile` or `docker-compose.yml` exists in the project root
5. Record `{ plugin_name, has_activity: bool }` for each detected plugin.
6. Proceed to Step 1. The cross-plugin hints are appended AFTER own status is rendered in Step 3.

### Step 1: Load Configuration

1. From the `## Arness` section, extract **Spark fields**:
   - **Vision directory** (e.g., `.arness/vision/`)
   - **Use cases directory** (e.g., `.arness/use-cases/`)
   - **Prototypes directory** (e.g., `.arness/prototypes/`)
   - **Spikes directory** (e.g., `.arness/spikes/`)
   - **Visual grounding directory** (e.g., `.arness/visual-grounding/`)
   - **Reports directory** (e.g., `.arness/reports/`)

**If `## Arness` is missing or no Spark fields present:** Show the Spark pipeline diagram with all stages unmarked. Suggest `arn-brainstorming` to start a new greenfield project. Do not attempt detection.

---

### Step 2: Detect Pipeline Position

Read the pipeline reference file at `<arn-spark-plugin-root>/skills/arn-spark-help/references/pipeline-map.md` to load detection rules, rendering templates, and next-step tables.

Check from most advanced to least advanced — first match wins:

1. **Feature backlog ready** (`gf-feature-extract`): `<vision-dir>/features/feature-backlog.md` exists
2. **Prototype locked** (`gf-prototype-lock`): `<prototypes-dir>/locked/LOCKED.md` exists
3. **Clickable prototype done** (`gf-clickable-proto`): `<prototypes-dir>/clickable/final-report.md` exists
4. **Static prototype done** (`gf-static-proto`): `<prototypes-dir>/static/final-report.md` exists
5. **Style defined** (`gf-style-explore`): `<vision-dir>/style-brief.md` exists
6. **Visual direction chosen** (`gf-visual-sketch`): `<vision-dir>/visual-direction.md` exists
7. **Spike complete** (`gf-spike`): `<vision-dir>/spike-results.md` exists
8. **Scaffold built** (`gf-scaffold`): `<vision-dir>/scaffold-summary.md` exists
9. **Use cases written** (`gf-use-cases`): At least one `UC-*.md` file exists in `<use-cases-dir>/`
10. **Architecture defined** (`gf-arch-vision`): `<vision-dir>/architecture-vision.md` exists
11. **Naming complete** (`gf-naming`): `<vision-dir>/naming-brief.md` exists OR `<reports-dir>/naming-report.md` exists
12. **Concept reviewed** (`gf-concept-review`): `<reports-dir>/stress-tests/concept-review-report.md` exists
13. **Stress tests run** (`gf-stress-test`): Any of `interview-report.md`, `competitive-report.md`, `premortem-report.md`, `prfaq-report.md` exists in `<reports-dir>/stress-tests/`
14. **Product discovered** (`gf-discover`): `<vision-dir>/product-concept.md` exists
15. **Spark initialized** (`gf-init`): Spark fields exist in `## Arness` but none of the above artifacts found

**Spark complete:** If the detected stage is `gf-feature-extract`, Spark exploration is considered complete.

### Step 3: Render Pipeline Diagram

Read the pipeline templates from `<arn-spark-plugin-root>/skills/arn-spark-help/references/pipeline-map.md`.

1. Place the `YOU ARE HERE` marker below the detected stage.
2. Display the next-step suggestion from the next-step table.
3. Spark is a single-track pipeline (no per-project subdirectories).

**Own-plugin suggestions always come first.** After the pipeline diagram and next-step suggestion, append cross-plugin hints from Step 0:

- If own plugin has activity: show own status first. If other plugins have activity, append 1-2 lines at the bottom:
  ```
  Other pipelines: Development (active) — `arn-code-help` | Infrastructure (not started)
  ```

- If own plugin is idle (`gf-init`) but other plugins have activity: show own-plugin "ready to start" suggestions FIRST:
  ```
  Ready to start: run `arn-spark-discover` to shape your product idea, or `arn-brainstorming` for the guided wizard.
  ```
  Then mention others:
  ```
  You also have active work in Code — run `arn-code-help` for details.
  ```

- When Spark pipeline is complete (`gf-feature-extract`): suggest transition:
  ```
  Spark exploration is complete. Next steps:
  - Start developing features: `arn-planning`
  - Deploy infrastructure: `arn-infra-wizard`
  ```

Keep output concise — the user wants a quick status check, not a wall of text.

---

### Step 4: Answer Follow-up Questions

After presenting the pipeline status:

1. Remain available for follow-up questions about the Spark pipeline, skill purposes, or workflow decisions.
2. Reference `<arn-spark-plugin-root>/skills/arn-spark-help/references/pipeline-map.md` for answers — do not re-scan the filesystem unless the user explicitly asks to refresh the detection.
3. Keep answers brief and direct.

Common questions the user might ask:
- "What is Spark?" — Spark is the exploration phase for new projects. It takes a raw idea through structured discovery, validation, prototyping, and feature extraction before development begins.
- "How do I run the full Spark pipeline?" — Run `arn-brainstorming`, which walks through the entire exploration pipeline with guided decision gates.
- "What are stress tests?" — Four adversarial lenses that test your product concept: synthetic user interviews, competitive gap analysis, pre-mortem failure analysis, and PR/FAQ stress testing.
- "What is naming?" — A structured 4-step brand naming methodology: strategic foundation, creative generation, qualitative scoring, and due diligence with WHOIS domain checking.
- "Can I skip stress tests?" — Yes, all stages are optional. The brainstorming wizard presents skip options at each gate.
- "How do I transition to development?" — After feature extraction, run `arn-planning` in the project. Arness Code sets up automatically on first use.
- "Where is the development pipeline status?" — Run `arn-code-help` for the Arness Code development pipeline.
- "Where is infrastructure status?" — Run `arn-infra-help` for the Arness Infra infrastructure pipeline.
- "What are the entry points?" — `arn-brainstorming` is the main Spark entry point. For development: `arn-planning`. For infrastructure: `arn-infra-wizard`.
- "What is dev-setup?" — `arn-spark-dev-setup` is a standalone skill for defining or onboarding to a development environment (dev containers, Docker, CI workflows). It can be run at any time after greenfield config exists.
- "What is visual-strategy?" — `arn-spark-visual-strategy` sets up layered visual regression testing infrastructure (capture scripts, baselines, comparison pipelines). Requires scaffold and at least style-explore to be complete.
- "What is visual-readiness?" — `arn-spark-visual-readiness` validates and activates deferred visual testing layers after project milestones. Requires a visual strategy to be defined first.

## Error Handling

- **`## Arness` section not found in CLAUDE.md** — Show the Spark pipeline diagram with no stage marked. Suggest running `arn-brainstorming` to start a new greenfield project.
- **CLAUDE.md does not exist** — Same as `## Arness` not found.
- **Spark fields present but directories don't exist** — Treat as `gf-init` stage. The directories may not have been created yet.
- **Pipeline reference file not found** — Inform the user that the pipeline-map.md reference is missing and suggest reinstalling or updating the Arness Spark plugin.
- **Reports directory not configured** — Skip stress-test, concept-review, and naming detection (these stages require the Reports directory). Proceed with detection from `gf-arch-vision` downward.

## Constraints

- This skill MUST NOT write or modify any files.
- This skill MUST NOT invoke any agents.
- All tools used must be read-only: Read, Glob, Grep.
- All command suggestions must use bare skill names (e.g., `arn-spark-discover`, `arn-code-help`). Do not use the fully qualified `plugin:skill` format in user-facing text.
