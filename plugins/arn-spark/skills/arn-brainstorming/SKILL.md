# Arness Brainstorming

Walk the user through the entire Arness greenfield exploration pipeline in a single continuous session. The wizard invokes each pipeline skill in sequence, only pausing at genuine decision gates where user input is needed. Conversational skills (discover, arch-vision) have internal feedback loops and flow without wizard-level gates.

This skill is a **sequencer and decision-gate handler**. It MUST NOT duplicate sub-skill logic. All pipeline work is done by the invoked skills. The wizard handles: entry routing, transitions between skills, progress display, and resumability.

## Step 0: Ensure Configuration

Read `<arn-spark-plugin-root>/skills/arn-spark-ensure-config/references/step-0-fast-path.md` and follow its instructions. This guarantees a user profile exists and `## Arness` is configured with Arness Spark fields before proceeding.

After Step 0 completes, extract from `## Arness`:
- Vision directory, Use cases directory, Prototypes directory, Spikes directory, Visual grounding directory, Reports directory

## Decision Gates

The wizard pauses at exactly 9 gates. Everything else flows automatically.

| Gate | When | Question | Options |
|------|------|----------|---------|
| G1 | Entry (artifacts detected) | "It looks like you have an in-progress greenfield pipeline. Resume or start fresh?" | Resume from [detected stage] / Start fresh |
| G-Stress | After discover | "Run stress tests on the product concept?" then "Select which stress tests to run" | Yes/Skip; then multi-select: Interview, Competitive, Pre-Mortem, PR/FAQ |
| G-Name | After stress-test/concept-review | "Explore brand names for your product?" | Yes / Skip |
| G2 | After arch-vision | "Write use cases before scaffolding?" | Write use cases (recommended) / Write use cases with expert debate (teams) / Skip to scaffold |
| G3 | After scaffold | "Validate technical risks before visual design?" | Run spikes (recommended if risks found) / Skip to visual sketch |
| G4 | Pre-prototype | "How should prototypes be validated?" | Standard review cycles / Expert debate (teams) for both / Expert debate (teams) for clickable only |
| G5 | After clickable prototype | "Lock the prototype and extract features?" | Lock prototype then extract features (recommended) / Extract features without locking / Review prototype first |
| G6 | After feature extraction | "Transition to development pipeline?" | Yes, invoke `arn-planning` / Not yet |
| G7 | Entry (add-feature intent + completed prototype) | "Adding a new feature. This will update use cases, iterate the prototype, and add to the feature backlog. Ready?" | Proceed / Choose which steps to include / Cancel |

## Workflow

### Step 0.5: Extract Configuration

1. Read the project's `## Arness` configuration section. For backward compatibility, this section is currently stored in `CLAUDE.md`; in Codex projects, preserve that location unless a project has already migrated its Arness config elsewhere.
2. Extract configuration fields needed for artifact detection:
   - **Vision directory** — for detecting product concept, architecture vision, scaffold summary, spike results, style brief, visual direction, feature backlog
   - **Use cases directory** — for detecting use case files
   - **Prototypes directory** — for detecting static and clickable prototype reports
   - **Spikes directory** — for detecting spike POC directories
   - **Visual grounding directory** — for detecting captured design references
   - **Reports directory** — for detecting stress test reports and concept review report

### Step 1: Detect Pipeline State (Resumability)

Check which artifacts exist on disk to determine if the user is resuming a previous pipeline run. Check from most advanced to least advanced — first match wins:

| Artifact | Detected State | Resume Point |
|----------|---------------|--------------|
| User says "add feature" / "new feature" AND `<prototypes-dir>/clickable/final-report.md` exists | Add Feature mode | Start at Add Feature Mode (Step AF) |
| `<vision-dir>/features/feature-backlog.md` | Feature extraction complete | Resume at G6 |
| `<prototypes-dir>/locked/LOCKED.md` exists AND NO `<vision-dir>/features/feature-backlog.md` | Prototype locked, extraction pending | Resume at feature-extract directly (invoke `arn-spark-feature-extract`, skip G5 lock step — already locked) |
| `F-*.md` files in `<vision-dir>/features/` but NO `<vision-dir>/features/feature-backlog.md` | Feature extraction interrupted | Resume at feature-extract (invoke to complete/rebuild the Feature Tracker) |
| `<prototypes-dir>/clickable/final-report.md` | Clickable prototype done | Resume at G5 |
| `<prototypes-dir>/static/final-report.md` | Static prototype done | Resume at clickable prototype (Step 9b) |
| `<vision-dir>/style-brief.md` | Style defined | Resume at static prototype (Step 9a) |
| `<vision-dir>/visual-direction.md` | Visual direction chosen | Resume at style-explore (Step 8) |
| `<vision-dir>/spike-results.md` | Spike complete | Resume at visual-sketch (Step 7) |
| `<vision-dir>/scaffold-summary.md` | Scaffold built | Resume at G3 |
| `UC-*.md` in `<use-cases-dir>/` | Use cases written | Resume at scaffold (Step 5) |
| `<vision-dir>/architecture-vision.md` | Architecture defined | Resume at G2 |
| `<reports-dir>/stress-tests/concept-review-report.md` AND `<vision-dir>/naming-brief.md` with "Final Decision" section populated | Concept review + naming complete | Resume at arch-vision (Step 3) |
| `<reports-dir>/stress-tests/concept-review-report.md` AND `<vision-dir>/naming-brief.md` exists but no "Final Decision" section | Naming in progress | Resume at G-Name (naming skill handles internal resume) |
| `<reports-dir>/stress-tests/concept-review-report.md` AND NO `<vision-dir>/naming-brief.md` | Concept review complete, naming not started | Resume at G-Name |
| Any stress test report (`interview-report.md`, `competitive-report.md`, `premortem-report.md`, `prfaq-report.md`) in `<reports-dir>/stress-tests/` but NO `concept-review-report.md` | Stress tests run, review pending | Resume at concept review offer within G-Stress |
| `<vision-dir>/product-concept.md` | Product discovered | Resume at G-Stress |
| Greenfield fields but no artifacts | Greenfield initialized | Begin at discover (Step 2) |

**If artifacts are detected:**

Show the detected state and ask:

Ask the user:

> **It looks like you have an in-progress greenfield pipeline at [detected stage]. Would you like to resume or start fresh?**
> 1. **Resume from [detected stage]** — Skip to the detected resume point
> 2. **Start fresh** — Begin at Step 2 (existing artifacts are preserved)

**If ambiguous or conflicting artifacts are detected** (e.g., architecture-vision.md exists but no product-concept.md, or multiple conflicting states): list the detected artifacts and ask the user to clarify which state to resume from.

**If no artifacts detected:** skip G1 and proceed directly to Step 2.

### Step 2: Product Discovery (Automated)

Show progress:
```
Spark Pipeline: DISCOVER --> stress-test --> naming --> arch-vision --> use-cases --> scaffold --> spike --> visual-sketch --> style-explore --> prototypes --> feature-extract
                ^^^^^^^^
```

Inform the user: "Let's start by shaping your product idea..."

> Codex skill `arn-spark-discover`

The discover skill has its own internal conversation loop with the product strategist agent. When it completes, `product-concept.md` exists in the vision directory.

---

### Step 2.5: Gate G-Stress — Stress Test Decision

Show progress:
```
Spark Pipeline: discover --> STRESS-TEST --> naming --> arch-vision --> use-cases --> scaffold --> spike --> visual-sketch --> style-explore --> prototypes --> feature-extract
                            ^^^^^^^^^^^
```

**Step 1 of gate — Explain and ask:**

Briefly explain stress testing and each available test:

"Before committing to an architecture, you can stress-test the product concept to validate assumptions and identify blind spots. Four tests are available:

1. **Synthetic User Interview** — Generates synthetic personas (Pragmatist, Skeptic, Power User) from your product concept and conducts structured interviews to surface usability concerns and unmet needs.
2. **Competitive Gap Analysis** — Deep feature-by-feature comparison against identified competitors, revealing gaps in your positioning and missed opportunities.
3. **Pre-Mortem** — Assumes the product has already failed and investigates the most likely root causes, using Gary Klein's pre-mortem framework.
4. **PR/FAQ** — Drafts a press release for your product and then adversarially critiques it, exposing weak value propositions and messaging gaps.

Stress testing is optional but recommended — it validates WHAT you are building before committing to HOW."

Ask the user:

**"Run stress tests on the product concept?"**

Options:
1. **Yes, run stress tests** (Recommended) — Validate the concept before architecture
2. **Skip to architecture vision** — Proceed without stress testing

If **Skip** → proceed to Step 3 (arch-vision).

**Step 2 of gate — Multi-select:**

Ask the user (multi-select):

**"Select which stress tests to run (select all that apply):"**

Options:
1. **Synthetic User Interview** — Persona-driven interviews revealing usability concerns
2. **Competitive Gap Analysis** — Feature comparison against competitors
3. **Pre-Mortem** — Investigate likely causes of product failure
4. **PR/FAQ** — Draft and adversarially critique a press release

Invoke each selected stress test skill in sequence:

- If Interview selected → Codex skill `arn-spark-stress-interview`
- If Competitive selected → Codex skill `arn-spark-stress-competitive`
- If Pre-Mortem selected → Codex skill `arn-spark-stress-premortem`
- If PR/FAQ selected → Codex skill `arn-spark-stress-prfaq`

**After all selected tests complete:**

"Stress tests complete. [N] report(s) generated. Run concept review to synthesize findings into product concept updates?"

Ask the user:

**"Review and update the product concept based on stress test findings?"**

Options:
1. **Yes, review and update concept** (Recommended) — Synthesize findings and propose concept changes
2. **Skip** — Keep concept as-is and proceed to architecture vision

If **Yes** → Codex skill `arn-spark-concept-review`. After concept review completes, proceed to Step 2.7 (G-Name).

If **Skip** → proceed to Step 2.7 (G-Name).

---

### Step 2.7: Gate G-Name — Brand Naming Decision

Show progress:
```
Spark Pipeline: discover --> stress-test --> NAMING --> arch-vision --> use-cases --> scaffold --> spike --> visual-sketch --> style-explore --> prototypes --> feature-extract
                                             ^^^^^^
```

Ask the user:

**"Would you like to explore brand names for your product?"**

Options:
1. **Yes, find a name** (Recommended) — Run the structured 4-step naming process
2. **Skip** — I already have a name or will name it later

If **Yes** → Codex skill `arn-spark-naming`. After naming completes, proceed to Step 3 (arch-vision).

If **Skip** → proceed to Step 3 (arch-vision).

---

### Step 3: Architecture Vision (Automated)

Show progress:
```
Spark Pipeline: discover --> stress-test --> naming --> ARCH-VISION --> use-cases --> scaffold --> spike --> visual-sketch --> style-explore --> prototypes --> feature-extract
                                                       ^^^^^^^^^^^
```

Inform the user: "Product concept is ready. Now let's explore the architecture..."

> Codex skill `arn-spark-arch-vision`

The arch-vision skill has its own internal conversation loop with the tech evaluator agent. When it completes, `architecture-vision.md` exists in the vision directory.

---

### Step 4: Gate G2 — Use Cases Decision

Show progress:
```
Spark Pipeline: discover --> stress-test --> naming --> arch-vision --> USE-CASES --> scaffold --> spike --> visual-sketch --> style-explore --> prototypes --> feature-extract
                                                                                       ^^^^^^^^^
```

Ask the user:

**"Architecture vision is complete. Write use cases before scaffolding?"**

Options:
1. **Write use cases** (Recommended) — Structured behavioral requirements in Cockburn format
2. **Write use cases with expert debate** (Teams) — Multi-agent debate format with product strategist and UX specialist
3. **Skip to scaffold** — Proceed without formal use cases

Based on the user's choice:

- **Write use cases** → Codex skill `arn-spark-use-cases`
- **Expert debate** → Codex skill `arn-spark-use-cases-teams`
- **Skip** → mark use-cases as skipped and proceed to Step 5

---

### Step 5: Scaffold (Automated)

Show progress:
```
Spark Pipeline: discover --> stress-test --> naming --> arch-vision --> use-cases --> SCAFFOLD --> spike --> visual-sketch --> style-explore --> prototypes --> feature-extract
                                                                                                 ^^^^^^^^
```

Inform the user: "Setting up the project skeleton with the chosen tech stack..."

> Codex skill `arn-spark-scaffold`

The scaffold skill creates the project structure, installs dependencies, and produces a buildable project. When it completes, `scaffold-summary.md` exists in the vision directory.

---

### Step 6: Gate G3 — Spike Decision

Show progress:
```
Spark Pipeline: discover --> stress-test --> naming --> arch-vision --> use-cases --> scaffold --> SPIKE --> visual-sketch --> style-explore --> prototypes --> feature-extract
                                                                                                         ^^^^^
```

Before asking, read `architecture-vision.md` from the vision directory and check for a "Risks" or "Known Risks" section. Count the number of identified risks.

Ask the user:

**"Scaffold complete. Validate technical risks before moving to visual design?"**

Options (if risks were found in architecture vision):
1. **Run spikes** (Recommended — [N] risks identified in architecture vision) — Validate risky assumptions with proof-of-concept code
2. **Skip to visual sketch** — Proceed to visual design without risk validation

Options (if no risks section found):
1. **Run spikes anyway** — Validate key assumptions even though no explicit risks were documented
2. **Skip to visual sketch** (Recommended) — Proceed to visual design

If **Run spikes:**
> Codex skill `arn-spark-spike`

If **Skip:** mark spike as skipped and proceed to Step 7.

---

### Step 7: Visual Sketch (Automated)

Show progress:
```
Spark Pipeline: discover --> stress-test --> naming --> arch-vision --> use-cases --> scaffold --> spike --> VISUAL-SKETCH --> style-explore --> prototypes --> feature-extract
                                                                                                          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
```

Inform the user: "Generating visual direction proposals..."

> Codex skill `arn-spark-visual-sketch`

The visual-sketch skill generates multiple direction proposals as live pages on the dev server. When it completes, `visual-direction.md` exists in the vision directory.

---

### Step 8: Style Explore (Automated)

Show progress:
```
Spark Pipeline: discover --> stress-test --> naming --> arch-vision --> use-cases --> scaffold --> spike --> visual-sketch --> STYLE-EXPLORE --> prototypes --> feature-extract
                                                                                                                            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
```

Inform the user: "Defining the design system from the chosen visual direction..."

> Codex skill `arn-spark-style-explore`

The style-explore skill defines color palettes, typography, component styles, and toolkit configuration. When it completes, `style-brief.md` exists in the vision directory.

---

### Step 9: Gate G4 — Prototype Validation Mode

Show progress:
```
Spark Pipeline: discover --> stress-test --> naming --> arch-vision --> use-cases --> scaffold --> spike --> visual-sketch --> style-explore --> PROTOTYPES --> feature-extract
                                                                                                                                          ^^^^^^^^^^
```

Ask the user:

**"Style system defined. How should prototypes be validated?"**

Options:
1. **Standard review cycles** — Build-review-iterate with expert scoring and UX judge verdict
2. **Expert debate (teams) for both** — Multi-agent debate for static and clickable prototypes
3. **Expert debate (teams) for clickable only** — Standard for static, debate for clickable

Based on choice, invoke the prototype skills in sequence:

**Standard:**
> Codex skill `arn-spark-static-prototype`
> Then: Codex skill `arn-spark-clickable-prototype`

**Teams for both:**
> Codex skill `arn-spark-static-prototype-teams`
> Then: Codex skill `arn-spark-clickable-prototype-teams`

**Teams for clickable only:**
> Codex skill `arn-spark-static-prototype`
> Then: Codex skill `arn-spark-clickable-prototype-teams`

After each prototype skill completes, show an intermediate progress update before invoking the next.

---

### Step 10: Gate G5 — Post-Prototype Actions

Show progress:
```
Spark Pipeline: discover --> stress-test --> naming --> arch-vision --> use-cases --> scaffold --> spike --> visual-sketch --> style-explore --> prototypes --> FEATURE-EXTRACT
                                                                                                                                                            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
```

Before asking, check if `<prototypes-dir>/locked/LOCKED.md` exists.

**If prototype is already locked:**

"Prototype is already locked (see `prototypes/locked/LOCKED.md`). Proceeding directly to feature extraction."

> Codex skill `arn-spark-feature-extract`

Skip the G5 question — locking is already done. After feature-extract completes, proceed to G6.

**If prototype is NOT locked:**

Ask the user:

**"Prototype validation complete. What next?"**

Options:
1. **Lock prototype and extract features** (Recommended) — Protect the validated prototype, then build the feature backlog
2. **Extract features without locking** — Build the backlog without prototype protection
3. **Review prototype first** — Look at the validation results before deciding

If **Lock and extract:**
> Codex skill `arn-spark-prototype-lock`
> Then: Codex skill `arn-spark-feature-extract`

If **Extract without locking:**
> Codex skill `arn-spark-feature-extract`

If **Review first:**
- Read the final reports from both static and clickable prototype directories
- Present a summary of the validation results (verdicts, scores, key findings)
- Then re-ask: "Lock and extract, or extract only?"

---

### Step 11: Gate G6 — Transition to Development

Show progress:
```
Spark Pipeline: discover --> stress-test --> naming --> arch-vision --> use-cases --> scaffold --> spike --> visual-sketch --> style-explore --> prototypes --> feature-extract
                       ✓            ✓              ✓              ✓             ✓           ✓           ✓                ✓               ✓               ✓
```

Before asking about transition, check if features have been uploaded to the issue tracker:

1. Read `## Arness` config for **Issue tracker** field (`github`, `jira`, or `none`). If not present, treat as `none`.
2. If Issue tracker is `none`: skip this check.
3. If Issue tracker is `github` or `jira`:
   a. Read `<vision-dir>/features/feature-backlog.md` and check the Feature Tracker table's Issue column.
   b. If ALL features have `--` in the Issue column (none uploaded):

      Ask the user:

      > **Your feature backlog has [N] features but none have been uploaded to [GitHub/Jira] yet. Would you like to upload them now?** This creates issues for team visibility and enables `arn-code-pick-issue` for feature selection.
      > 1. **Upload now** — Create issues for all features
      > 2. **Skip** — Continue without uploading

      If **Upload now** → Codex skill `arn-spark-feature-extract` (the skill detects existing features and runs Step 7 upload)
      If **Skip** → Continue to transition question

   c. If SOME features have issue numbers (partial upload):

      Ask the user:

      > **[M] of [N] features have been uploaded to [GitHub/Jira]. Would you like to upload the remaining [K]?**
      > 1. **Upload remaining** — Create issues for the remaining features
      > 2. **Skip** — Continue without uploading

      If **Upload remaining** → Codex skill `arn-spark-feature-extract`
      If **Skip** → Continue to transition question

   d. If ALL features have issue numbers: skip this check silently.

Then proceed:

Ask the user:

**"Greenfield exploration is complete. Feature backlog is ready. Transition to the development pipeline?"**

Options:
1. **Yes, start developing** — Invoke `arn-planning` to begin planning features from the backlog. Arness auto-configures code patterns, plans, specs, and report templates on first use.
2. **Not yet** — Stay in greenfield mode; transition later

If **Yes:**
> Codex skill `arn-planning`

If **Not yet:**
- Show what was completed
- Inform: "Invoke `arn-planning` when ready to transition. Arness auto-configures on first use. Your greenfield artifacts are preserved."

---

### Step 12: Complete

Show final progress:
```
Spark Pipeline: discover --> stress-test --> naming --> arch-vision --> use-cases --> scaffold --> spike --> visual-sketch --> style-explore --> prototypes --> feature-extract
                       ✓            ✓              ✓              ✓             ✓           ✓           ✓                ✓               ✓               ✓
```

Present a completion summary:
- **Product concept:** `<vision-dir>/product-concept.md`
- **Brand name:** `<vision-dir>/naming-brief.md` — [chosen name] (or "skipped")
- **Architecture:** `<vision-dir>/architecture-vision.md`
- **Use cases:** [count] use cases in `<use-cases-dir>/` (or "skipped")
- **Scaffold:** `<vision-dir>/scaffold-summary.md`
- **Spikes:** `<vision-dir>/spike-results.md` (or "skipped")
- **Visual direction:** `<vision-dir>/visual-direction.md`
- **Style:** `<vision-dir>/style-brief.md`
- **Static prototype:** `<prototypes-dir>/static/final-report.md`
- **Clickable prototype:** `<prototypes-dir>/clickable/final-report.md`
- **Prototype lock:** [yes / no]
- **Feature backlog:** `<vision-dir>/features/feature-backlog.md` — [feature count] features
- **Development transition:** [initialized / deferred]

"Pipeline complete. Invoke `arn-brainstorming` again to re-explore, or `arn-planning` for the development pipeline."

---

### Add Feature Mode

Triggered when the user wants to add a new feature to a completed greenfield project. This mode sequences the incremental update skills in dependency order: use cases provide the behavioral foundation, the prototype validates the UI, and feature extraction adds to the backlog. Handles locked prototypes by iterating to a new version and re-locking.

> Read `<arn-spark-plugin-root>/skills/arn-brainstorming/references/add-feature-flow.md` for the full Add Feature mode workflow.

---

## Error Handling

- **Sub-skill fails or errors out:** Present the error to the user. Ask whether to retry this step, skip this step, or abort the wizard. If retry, re-invoke the same skill. If skip, continue to the next gate. If abort, show what was completed and exit.
- **User says "stop" or "pause":** Show what has been completed and what's next. Inform the user they can resume by invoking `arn-brainstorming` again (artifact detection will pick up where they left off).
- **Arness greenfield not initialized:** Handled by Step 0 ensure-config, which auto-configures with sensible defaults.
- **Architecture vision has no risks section at G3:** Adjust the spike recommendation — default suggestion becomes "Skip" instead of "Run spikes". Show: "No explicit risks identified in the architecture vision."
- **Scaffold fails to build:** The scaffold skill has its own error handling with retries. If it ultimately fails, ask: retry scaffold / abort wizard. Do not skip scaffold — it is required for all subsequent visual steps.
- **Prototype validation does not reach PASS verdict:** After the sub-skill returns, inform the user: "The prototype did not reach a PASS verdict. Continue to feature extraction anyway, or iterate more on the prototype?" If iterate: re-invoke the prototype skill. If continue: proceed to G5.
- **arn-spark plugin not installed:** If skill invocations fail because the greenfield plugin is missing, inform: "The arn-spark plugin must be installed from the Arness marketplace before running this workflow."
- **Teams variant not available at G2 or G4:** If the user selects a teams variant but the environment does not support coordinated multi-agent/team mode, inform them and suggest the standard option instead.
- **Product concept already exists when starting fresh:** The discover skill handles this internally (asks to replace or refine). The wizard does not need separate handling.
- **Add Feature mode invoked without completed prototype:** Redirect to normal wizard flow. Inform: "Add Feature mode requires a completed clickable prototype. Let's start with the full pipeline instead."
- **Locked prototype during Add Feature:** The lock protects the frozen snapshot, not the working directory. Prototype iteration creates a new version alongside the locked one. After iteration, the wizard offers to re-lock with the new version.
- **Feature extraction interrupted (partial feature files exist without Feature Tracker):** Detected by finding `F-*.md` files in the features directory without `feature-backlog.md`. Invoke `arn-spark-feature-extract` which handles resume and rebuilds the Feature Tracker from existing feature files.
- **Features not uploaded to issue tracker:** Detected at G6 by checking the Feature Tracker's Issue column. If all entries show `--`, offer to upload before transitioning to development.

## Constraints

- This skill MUST NOT duplicate sub-skill logic. It only handles sequencing and decision gates.
- All pipeline work is done by invoking the referenced Codex skills.
- Progress display uses the compact format shown above — one line showing the full pipeline with the current stage highlighted.
- The wizard runs in normal conversation (not plan mode).
- Skill invocations use Codex skill names: `arn-spark-<name>` for greenfield skills, `arn-brainstorming` for this sequencer, and `arn-planning` for the development pipeline transition.
- Add Feature mode uses the same sub-skill invocation pattern as the main pipeline.
- Add Feature mode never unlocks or modifies a locked prototype snapshot. It iterates to a new version and optionally re-locks.
